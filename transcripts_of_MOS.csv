2,James O’Rourke,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining our first quarter 2023 earnings call. Mosaic delivered revenues of $3.6 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $777 million and adjusted earnings of $1.14 per share. The fundamentals of the agriculture market remain quite attractive. Global stock-to-use ratios for grain and oilseeds are at 25-year lows. To put that in context, it would take 2 to 3 years of perfect weather and adequate fertilizer applications in every major growing region around the world just to get back to normal levels.', 'With weather patterns shifting to an El Niño environment, the likelihood of that happening is low and would be exacerbated by under fertilization. We are beginning to see the negative impacts on crop production. Yields in the European Union turned lower in 2022 because of poor weather and under fertilization and will remain under pressure this year if fertilizer applications remain down.', ""We're seeing a similar story in rice. The combination of El Niño and under fertilization could further threaten yields in key growing regions. With reduced supply of sunflower seed oil because of the ongoing war in Ukraine, the global market needs alternative edible oils and is looking to palm oil as an important substitute. Lack of fertilization, particularly potash, will impact Southeast Asian production. All of these factors are expected to support global crop prices for the foreseeable future."", ""Switching to fertilizer markets, farmer affordability for phosphates and potash globally is very good with prices that are much more sustainable than the levels we saw a year ago. This is bringing growers back into the market, though supply constraints are still a concern. In potash, Belarusian exports remain limited because of sanctions. We've seen volumes move by rail into China and, to a lesser extent, through excess Russian port capacity, but transportation costs are high, and total exports remain well below pre-sanctioned levels. This year, we expect total exports from Belarus to be roughly 7 million tonnes. In addition, we also continue to see indications of reduced Russian product as well."", ""It is clear that today's potash market is tight and supply chain is under pressure, but this extends beyond just Belarus and Russia. This vulnerability is highlighted by the recent failure of the walkway on a conveyor Canpotex 4 million tonne per year Portland terminal. Canpotex is still assessing the total damage, but expects to redirect much of the lost volume to other North American ports, albeit at some additional cost."", ""In Phosphates, China remains committed to a structural shift away from exports. While it's possible to see a modest increase in exports over the 2022 total of 6.4 million tonnes. Domestic fertilizer demand, rising industrial consumption and environmental restrictions will cap China shipments to other markets. These supply constraints remain even as demand in our key customer markets is seeing a recovery."", ""In North America, spring planting season is well underway, and farmers have returned to the market, though retailers have been slow to adjust their prices to global wholesale market prices. Despite that resistance, growers are still committing and taking tonnes. Retailers are replenishing their inventories. In April, Mosaic's volumes saw a significant rebound in the North American shipments for both potash and phosphate. Combined, Mosaic shipped over 1 million tonnes of potash and phosphates to North American customers in April alone."", ""This is the highest total we've seen in the last 5 years. In Brazil, the is supportive of demand, and we expect commitments for the third quarter to ramp up with prepays for fertilizer ahead of the softer season. We expect Brazil will see a 9% to 10% increase in fertilizer shipments in 2023 over last year."", ""In India, inventories for potash remain depleted as all purchases are going straight to the ground. After a year of reduced potash applications, a potash contract was signed in April at a price of $422 per tonne. In addition to providing necessary supply to Indian farmers, the contract helps stabilize global pricing. In Southeast Asia, with the shortfall in edible oils globally, the palm market is driving strong demand. Globally, we're seeing good farmer economics, which suggest strong demand for phosphates and potash in 2023."", ""Given this landscape, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit from today's market conditions. In Phosphates, after 2 years of production issues caused by multiple hurricanes, raw material shortages and other issues, the segment's performance has improved. Volumes during the quarter were higher than any quarter in 2022, and our stripping margins also benefited from lower raw materials costs. We expect both of these trends to continue in 2023."", 'In the second quarter, we anticipate total sales volumes of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes with DAP FOB prices at the plant in the range of $550 to $600 per tonne. In Potash, volumes began to move over the last week of the first quarter, and that has continued into the second quarter, especially in North America. We expect demand to continue recovering throughout the year. Our operations at Esterhazy and Belle Plaine are performing well. Esterhazy is one of the most efficient mines in the world, and Belle Plaine should see benefit from lower natural gas costs in 2023.', ""At Esterhazy, the last of the 13 miners is expected to come online later this year. In total, Esterhazy's annual operational run rate should increase from 5.5 million tonnes last year to well over 6 million tonnes by the end of 2023. We're committed to producing enough potash to meet market demand. With the incremental output from Esterhazy, we believe we're producing what the market needs, which means we'll only restart Colonsay when it's needed. We don't think this will be before the second half of the year."", 'In the second quarter, we expect total sales volumes of 2 million to 2.2 million tonnes with MOP prices at the mine in the range of $325 to $375 per tonne. In Brazil, first quarter results reflected the impact of declining prices and inventory destocking. As we said in February, we expected our Q1 results to be impacted by destocking of high-priced inventory. And now that is largely behind us.', ""Looking ahead, we expect distribution margins to trend back towards the range of $30 to $40 a tonne. In the second quarter, 90% of those tonnes are already committed and priced. Finally, I want to reiterate that we are committed to our capital allocation strategy of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in our business and returning capital to shareholders. We've met our commitment of reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. As such, we expect to refinance the $900 million that matures later this year."", ""Our CapEx spending expectation this year remains unchanged at $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion. We're focused on high returning modest spend projects like our distribution facility in expansion of MicroEssentials at Riverview and the exploration of purified phosphoric acid. Beyond that, all excess free cash flow will be returned to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks."", ""During the quarter, we returned $608 million, which included $456 million of share repurchases and $152 million in special and regular dividends. Over the last 18 months, we've repurchased 15% of our float and still believe our shares represent very good value. Our regular dividend today is $0.80 per share, and our business positions us to consider further increases over time."", 'Before we move to the Q&A, let me summarize. The global ag market remains constructive. Grain and oilseed supplies are tight, and growers are incented by favorable economics to apply nutrients. We are already seeing the recovery in shipments in North America and expect the rest of the world to follow. Our production operations are performing well. Phosphate production has recovered, and potash is benefiting from the most efficient mines in the world with swing capacity available to meet demand growth.', ""Our balance sheet is strong and sustainable over the long term, and we remain committed to returning significant capital to shareholders while continuing to invest efficiently in the business. With that, I'd like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.""]",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
3,Paul Massoud,"[""Before we move on to live Q&A, as we've done in past quarters, we'd like to address some of the most common questions we received after we published our earnings materials last night."", 'Joc, the first question that we received was, how do we see ag markets evolving over the rest of 2023?']",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
4,James O’Rourke,"[""Thank you. While there has been recent volatility in the agricultural markets, the fundamentals remain strong. We're starting with a 25-year low stock-to-use ratio for grains and oilseeds. Now much has been made of Brazil's larger-than-expected crop, but offsetting that is problems in the Argentinian, Europe, Asia and others who are suffering from lower yields due to weather and under fertilizations."", ""Then as we look at going forward, this year's El Niño and under fertilization brings up a real risk to the 2023 ag markets. Now weather is always a known uncertainty. But as we've seen in recent past, extreme weather events that negatively impact ag production seem to have become more commonplace. Longer term, we do continue to see great potential for demand growth from biofuels, including an increased call on oilseeds to feed renewable diesel production as well as the enormous potential for sustainable aviation fuel."", 'We also believe that biofuel use will continue to rise in the medium term even as cars transition towards electrification. To sum up, there is a rational basis for ag commodity prices to have eased off in recent weeks. However, there is strong fundamentals for ag bullishness .']",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
5,Paul Massoud,"['Joc, a follow-on to the ag markets question. How do we see what you just said impacting fertilizer markets over the rest of this year?']",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
6,James O’Rourke,"[""Well, thank you. I'd like to start by saying what we're seeing in North America demonstrates just how strong the market could be this year. If we look at North America in the months of March and April, those were both very strong months and up about 20% from where we were probably last year. So if I look forward there, I expect that will carry over to a stronger season in Brazil once the application gets started, and then it will continue for Asia and other regions. Now I'm going to turn it over to Jenny to give a little more detail on the supply and demand of the fertilizer markets.""]",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
7,Jenny Wang,"['Sure, Joc. Let me start from phosphate. The export control out of China is going to continue as the country is going through phosphate industry shift from production on fertilizers to industrial products. The Chinese government is going to continue to ensure their farmers to have affordable and available fertilizers in country for their own production. The export restriction is going to continue to be in place. We believe this year, the export out of China will be somewhere between 7 million to 8 million tonnes.', 'With the tight supply of phosphate and the rebounding demand, we believe this is a very constructive margin environment for phosphate.', ""Turning over to potash. Export out of Belarus last year had significantly reduced from 12 million tonnes to 5 million tonnes. This year, despite multiple export corridors being utilized by Belarus, we still don't believe that they have opportunity to export over 8 million tonnes out of Belarus. And the production out of Russia is continuously under the risk. On the demand side, as Joc mentioned, we are seeing a very strong spring season in North America."", ""In the market when spring application have started, we're seeing a bigger volume and we have seen price appreciation in the market. And in the market in Northern plants, where the spring season are still ongoing, we have started to get inquiries from our customers for their summer fuel demand. This demand to summer fuel and applications are indicating a strong and robust demand for the full season in North America. We believe what is happening in North America is going to happen in a market like Brazil, where they are going to prepare for their incoming seasons, and we believe they will engage soon. With strong demand in Asia, we believe the buyers will reengage and the price and volumes will respond positively.""]",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
8,Paul Massoud,"['Thank you, Jenny. The next question is a follow-on to what we just talked about. Given this constructive outlook on the fertilizer markets, can you explain your thinking behind the guidance for pricing and volume, particularly for Potash?']",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
9,James O’Rourke,"['Thank you. In Potash, we guided to a normal quarter in North America and a conservative view of the export market. Early quarter demand in North America is stronger than we would have expected and certainly stronger than normal. And history would say that the strong North American market will be followed in other markets such as Brazil and Asia. If this occurs, there is certainly upside to both potash volume and price. We have seen over and over again that once volumes move, price follows.']",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
10,Paul Massoud,"['Joc, our next question is on Mosaic results. Could you provide more color on the quarter and how you see the performance of the segment evolving over the rest of the year?']",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
11,James O’Rourke,"['Thank you. In the distribution business, the lead time to position products is quite long. As such, when the second half volumes were lower than we expected, we ended the year with high-priced inventory. Now we have sold most of this higher cost inventory down and expect the rest of the year to be much more normal. Transitioning between cycles can temporarily expand or contract margins, but true cycle margins remain unchanged.', 'For example, in quarter 4 of 2022 and quarter 1 of 2023, distribution margins were below historic levels, but they will return as market stability is achieved. Distribution margins in second quarter to the fourth quarter will be in the $30 to $40 range when averaged together.']",management_discussion,MOS_3249218
12,Clint Freeland,"[""Joc, one other thing that I would note that I think is important in this discussion is that we use average cost accounting for the cost of inventory in Brazil. And what that means is that as prices -- sales prices are moving either up or down, the average cost of inventory that we're recognizing in our results is moving a little slower than that market price. And as a result, during increasing price environment, you'll see expanding margins. During declining price environment, you'll see declining margins."", ""But that's why over the course of the year, we will see margins in the target range that we've talked about. But quarter-to-quarter, as market prices are moving, you can see a level of volatility in results.""]",management_discussion,MOS_3249218

14,Operator,['[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho.'],question_answer,MOS_3249218
15,Christopher Parkinson,"['Could you just give us a real quick update on how we should be thinking about your phosphate strip margins just across Florida rock cost, processing where sulfur is trending relative to last year as well as your ammonia mix? Just any insights on how that should affect phosphate margins throughout the balance of the year would be incredibly helpful?']",question_answer,MOS_3249218
16,James O’Rourke,"[""Chris, if we look at how we're projecting, I guess, stripping margins for the rest of the year, you will have seen that the raw material prices have declined in the last while. And obviously, I think I've talked before, the sulfur, it takes 0.4 of a tonne of sulfur basically to make a tonne of DAP and about 0.2 of a tonne of ammonia. So those moves, which have been quite material, have allowed -- even though the price of phosphates has come down in time, the actual margins have stayed relatively constant throughout that period."", ""And we see those margins staying relatively constant through the rest of the year. If we look at our cost of our actual inputs, rock and conversion, our rock costs were driven a little higher this quarter basically because of a lower volume throughout the quarter, probably due to both -- well, more than anything due to the grade of the area we've been mining through."", ""And then if we look at conversion costs, those have been impacted by higher variable and fixed costs such as electricity and process chemicals. For the balance of 2023, we believe our maintenance and capital assets that we've invested in should really improve both volumes and costs as we move forward.""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218
17,Operator,['Our next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. .'],question_answer,MOS_3249218
18,Stephen Byrne,"[""Your price for potash for the second quarter looks like it's roughly $75 a tonne more than historical levels and yet it sounds like Jenny's comments would suggest that potash is the one that is going to be more curtailed in supply in 2023 as opposed to your FOB DAP forecast is a couple of hundred dollars higher than historical prices."", 'So my question is, what is fundamentally different here between P and K that would lead potash pricing to be generally weaker? Is it a reflection of second-tier price coming out of Russia?']",question_answer,MOS_3249218
19,James O’Rourke,"[""Okay. Thanks, Steve. Yes, let me go through a couple of points there. I think what I said earlier in the prepared questions or whatever the early questions still holds, which is when we were setting up the quarter and doing our preparation for this, you're talking a couple of weeks ago, we hadn't seen fully the impact of what we would see in April and May -- or sorry, March and April. We're seeing that come in better than we expected."", ""So from a volume perspective, we're pretty confident that, that guidance is at least very realistic and probably even we could see upside on that. In terms of pricing, it's all about combination of what's going to watch market. For instance, it's product mix, whether we're selling the standard-grade product to some of the foreign markets where the prices are, a, lower and the transport is higher. But then secondly, how much is coming from North America, which is a strong market and a good -- both good pricing and a relatively lower transport."", ""And then Brazil, which really hasn't started yet. So as we end the North American spring and move into the -- or wind down the North American spring and move into the quarter, our question is going to be, does Brazil come in to replace the higher cost -- or the higher priced North American product? Or do we get more of a balance on other exports?"", ""In which case, it just makes it a little hard to come up with a real good forecast for those prices. But I think that the comment you make is more than valid. There is definite tightness in the potash market. We're seeing it probably strongest through North Africa. We're seeing it strong in Europe. And I think we're going to see the impacts of it in Asia. So our view is they have to step up soon and start buying and the price will follow.""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218
20,Operator,['Our next question comes from Ben Theurer from Barclays.'],question_answer,MOS_3249218
21,Benjamin Theurer,"['Actually, a good follow-up just on the price development and like long term versus short term. So if you think about all the comments you made around the structure challenges and obviously, the tightness, potash, you just reiterated, but still prices are not coming up that much. So maybe help us understand a little bit that in context prices being soft, but then at the same time, you do consider some of capacity increases towards the back half of the year. So just to understand a little bit the rationale behind the volume you plan to put in additionally, given where prices are?']",question_answer,MOS_3249218
22,James O’Rourke,"[""Yes, sure. So if I'm going through potash, again, it's the same story. First, we're going to see North America. We didn't see a strong -- although we don't sell to it, we didn't see a strong European market. But very quickly, we're going to turn over to Brazil and Latin America, that market should start moving. The softer season starts basically at the start of the third quarter, if you will. So they have to be moving product towards the end of this quarter."", ""So June, let's say, it's things have to start moving to get product in place in time. Now we're coming into the year. And I think one thing that has to be understood is there was some pretty severe overshoot last year. Price went high, usage went way down. And I think we're seeing an overshoot downwards right now. And so it's not following fundamentals. But long term, it has to. So Brazil and the rest of Latin America will start moving."", ""China is a very similar season to North America. And while they are getting more product from Belarus and Russia across from rail, they're still going to have to buy potash. So all of that stuff starts moving. Asia has to move. They need their staples like rice to grow. Indonesia, Malaysia needs the palm oil. So all of those start moving. We think it's still a constrained market. And the short-term -- sentiment drives short-term, fundamentals drive the longer term. So we think right now, it's just sentiment driven.""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218

Can we get back to what -- historically, we've seen kind of 2 million, 2.2 million tonnes per quarter coming out of that segment. And then just a question on the Q2 pricing guidance. Yesterday, we kind of saw U.S. NOLA DAP prices drop down to kind of like the low 500s. How does that factor into the price guidance for Q2?""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218
25,James O’Rourke,"[""I'll let Jenny talk a little bit about summer fill and whatnot. But let me start by the run rate. I think, realistically, our run rate has probably been a lot closer to 8.5 million tonnes per year since we shut down the Plant City operation. So 2.2 is probably at the top end. I think a good quarter for us will now run probably 2 to 2.1, but we would expect an average probably in that range as we go forward if everything is running well."", ""We've had -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we have had weather-related issues. Hurricane Ian shut us down for a fair bit, caused some real problems. So we think that, that number of, say, 8.5 is a better run rate than, let's say, 9 to 9.5 with all things sort of settled and looking at the possibilities. Let me talk -- get Jenny to talk a little bit. I think what you're talking about is summer fill pricing on phosphate. So let me get Jenny to talk about that.""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218
26,Jenny Wang,"[""Sure. Andrew, I believe the numbers that you talked about was DAP NOLA barge price. We noticed that as well. And as some of the trade publications reported, the lower prices may be driven by the incoming import vessels the traders play on the index setting. So that's what we learned, and that happened many times in the past. It does not necessarily represent the real market value."", 'As we go through this index setting, we will see the real value to be reflected for summer fill. Having said that, it is very normal for the market like North America, after spring season, we will see -- we might see a price reset. It happened usually in every year, but the price eventually is going to be supported by fundamentals as we discussed earlier.', 'Lastly, we want to remind ourselves, when we say phosphate market, it is a very constructive margin environment. As the raw material prices coming down, there are some pull through to the phosphate prices as well.']",question_answer,MOS_3249218
27,James O’Rourke,"[""And just don't forget the ever -- never ending logistics issues. I'm not convinced that product coming in through NOLA certainly isn't going to get there in time for most of spring. So it is about summer fill, not about spring demand.

30,James O’Rourke,"[""Let me start -- thanks, Joel. Let me start by saying that is the distribution margin that we're referring to there. And it's important to kind of think about that in terms of the overall. If you think last year, I think, in distribution, we sold approximately -- was it 6 million tonnes of distribution tonnes? So 6.5 million tonnes of distribution tonnes at -- I think it was about $60 on average. So if you think about that, that's contributing $200 million of the $1 billion."", ""And I know I'm probably adding to the confusion of how hard it is to estimate what Brazil looks like. But the distribution business itself is a pretty small piece of the overall. We make about $100 million a year of co-product sales, and we make the majority from our actual production business, selling our MAP and feed, TSP and SSP."", ""So those are the ones that are really -- and right now, that market is moving pretty slowly.

We were saying that last year, and I wouldn't change my view on that at all. If you think back to -- and you got to almost think back to the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, where you had -- for instance, President Bolsonaro of Brazil was in Canada asking for more product, you had him in Russia talking to Putin looking for more potash. You have this huge almost panic run on potash and phosphates as they're trying to make sure they had enough for the season."", ""And the price got to the point where it was literally, at least from a psychological perspective, unaffordable.

What could we have done differently? We were aware of the risk. And we've -- I think we talked about that risk in some of these meetings even."", ""So what can you do? Do you try and send more to those markets to make sure they're well supplied? We did that. But then, of course, when things slowed down, there's no way around it.

Firstly, so on your potash volume guide for the second quarter, you're talking it sounds like you think North America is going to be up year-on-year. So if that's the case, and I kind of split out like what Canpotex is doing then in the second quarter, what's applied it's implying that's kind of down 15% to 20% year-on-year. So I guess, is that right? Why would it be down that much taking less allocation there?"", ""And secondly, just wanted to follow on from Joe's question on Fertilizantes. So maybe how do you kind of see the normalized mid-cycle EBITDA in Fertilizantes now? And could you split that between distribution EBITDA and production EBITDA for us, please?""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218
41,James O’Rourke,"[""Yes. Okay, Lucas. Yes, potash volume, I think I said earlier, we have taken a relatively conservative view of international sales. And so yes, our portion of exports is a bit lower. And when I say this, I mean, we're looking right now. And I think what I would say is if North America keeps performing as it does, we'll be at the higher end of our guidance. And if the international market comes back, we'll be at the higher end of the guidance."", ""All I can say at this stage is probably there's -- we try to keep a balance, but there's probably a little more upside potential than there is downside risk. At this point, it looks like. Although, again, supply chain and everything else can become a risk in this. You can only move so much product."", ""Now the second question, Brazil, yes -- and again, let me -- so let me kind of highlight Brazil, if you will. I think you can look at Brazil as being -- 50% of their earnings are going to be a production kind of economics. Now you have to take into account the fact that the producing right in the market. So I think that one is probably 50% of Brazil's earnings come from that. 30% come from the distribution business, and the rest comes from other things like co-products and whatnot. So that's kind of how we look at it, and that's how we've tried to portray that business.""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218

43,Jeffrey Zekauskas,"[""A couple of questions about potash. India signed a contract for 6 months instead of a year this time in potash. Why do you think they did that? Why signed a short-term contract? Normally, China quickly follow suit after India signs a contract and maybe gets a $20 a tonne better price. And as you said, the Indian signed at 4 22 a tonne down from 5 90. But the Chinese didn't sign a contract down $20 a tonne. What do you make of that? And do you have an expectation for when the Chinese might sign a potash contract?""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218
44,James O’Rourke,"[""Yes. Okay. Thanks, Jeff. Look, let me start with India. It was not India that drove the 6-month contractor. It was the suppliers, including Canpotex, and I don't like to normally speak for Canpotex, but I can tell you that we don't think the fundamentals are such that the price is going to still be at 4 22 come 6 months from now or at least we thought there's pretty good upside potential. So that was the reason that was a 6-month, not a year."", ""In terms of China -- and recognize -- sorry, let me finish the India thing. The other thing with India though is it hasn't really taken off tonnage-wise because they haven't established the subsidy program. So while there is a contract price, the importers are still a little bit leery because there isn't a subsidy guarantee for them, which means the NPK plants are taking what they need, but they're taking it hand to mouth. So it's a bit problematic and it's more of a political and subsidy issue than it really is the -- on-the-ground demand."", ""In China, why didn't China follow? I think there's a couple of reasons. I think the first is they had the inventory that they needed for the short term, and there's -- they're looking for when do they really need product. And recognize that some things have changed in China. With 2 million tonnes coming from the rail across from Kazakhstan with -- from Belarus, and another 2 million plus coming over the euros from Uralkali and the Russians and then 6 million tonnes coming from Qinghai Lake and that production, your seaborne needs while still there are less than they were before."", ""So maybe we have to reassess what 2 million tonnes of inventory really means because I think it will last them a little longer because they're getting their basic needs. Now having said that, I think by about midyear, they still need seaborne tonnes. So I think there's still a place for them. But I will say, and we've been saying this for years, the relevance of the Chinese contract is becoming less and less overall because they're less and less reliant on seaborne tonnes.""]",question_answer,MOS_3249218

We're going to be 3 million tonnes of capacity at Belle Plaine."", ""And so overall, we've got 9 million tonnes of total capacity without Colonsay. So I think -- where it is company come in? I think if the export market really heats up and you start seeing good demand from China, good demand from India, good demand from Indonesia and Malaysia, Brazil start moving and Latin America, then you're going to start to see the potential for us to not only have the need the inventory will get run down that we have at the plants, and we may not be able to keep up with the 9.5."", ""Now if that only comes in lackluster, Colonsay probably doesn't run.

53,Joc O’Rourke,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining our full year 2022 earnings call. Mosaic had a record year in 2022, delivering revenues of $19 billion, adjusted EBITDA of $6.2 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $11.01.', 'In 2022, we reached several operational milestones that allowed us to benefit from strong prices. K3 reached its initial capacity of 5.5 million tons. In Brazil, we grew our distribution market share from 16% to 18%.', 'In North America in phosphates, performance products represented 43% of total sales volumes and now we have begun to look at expanding our MicroEssentials capacity further, which we will discuss later. These efforts are driving strong free cash flow generation, which allowed us to return significant capital to shareholders in 2022, while also strengthening our balance sheet.', 'Over the last 12 months, we have repurchased $1.7 billion worth of shares outstanding, if we include the fourth quarter of 2021, we have bought back more than 10% of the shares outstanding or roughly 40 million shares.', 'In addition to share repurchases, we have also paid investors nearly $200 million in dividends. Our regular dividend now stands at $0.80 per share, up from $0.60 per share the prior year. And on the balance sheet, we met our long-term debt reduction target of $1 billion with the retirement of $550 million of long-term debt in November.', 'Before diving into our business further, I’d like to briefly discuss broader agriculture and fertilizer markets. Ag market fundamentals remain very constructive, with December corn near $6 per bushel and November beans near $14 a bushel. This reflects ongoing global food security concerns at a time of disappointing production. Global stocks-to-use ratios are at 25-year lows and remain under pressure because of elevated risks that threaten output in 2023.', 'The world continues to watch the war in Ukraine. We have consulted with top military and foreign policy leaders who share our concern that the conflict seems unlikely to be resolved in the near-term and will have long lasting impacts, particularly in the production of key crops like wheat and sunflowers, which is a source of significant amount of the world’s edible oils.', 'Outside of Europe, we believe the USDA’s latest estimate for Argentinian production appears optimistic, as drought conditions during the growing season suggest yields will disappoint. In Brazil, weather has delayed the planting of safrinha corn, which could pressure the record crop that many are forecasting.', 'Around the world, we still see fertilizer shortages in many key agricultural markets, despite some major markets being well supplied. However, the overall shortage still threatens total production and this will underpin global crop prices for some time.', 'Now let’s focus on the fertilizer markets. The sharp spike in nutrient prices in the first half of last year resulted in growers aggressively mining their soils. As we enter 2023, phosphate and potash prices are now half of what they were at the peak.', 'With crop prices still very strong, farmer affordability for nutrients has improved significantly and is now back to the levels seen in 2020 and 2021. This suggests a strong rebound in demand as growers seek to maximize yields with sufficient fertilization.', 'The world is still short of potash. Certain markets are seeing more readily available supply, but this means other markets are not able to get what they need. Belarusian supply remains constrained because of the ongoing sanctions. We believe Belarus, Calais exports were down about 8 million tons in 2022, and we expect only modest recovery in 2023 with total exports of around 6 million tons to 7 million tons or half of their pre-sanctioned export volumes.', 'The limited product Belarus has been able to get out of the country has been aggressively marketed over the seasonally slow winter and we have seen similar actions from some Russian producers. This is driving recent weakness in prices, but we believe the phenomena is temporary and will reverse as spring demand ramps up.', 'In phosphates, China remains committed to the structural shift impacting where it sends its phosphoric acid. In addition to shutting down production for environmental reasons, a significant portion of phosphoric acid is now being directed to industrial uses, including the battery market.', 'Roughly 1 million tons of finished fertilizer equivalent was diverted to the battery market in 2022 and we think that will continue to grow rapidly over the next few years as additional battery capacity is added. This suggests China’s exports of phosphate fertilizers will continue to be down significantly as restrictions extend into 2023.', 'Inventory levels in our key markets for both phosphates and potash have declined considerably from the elevated levels observed in the second half of last year. Grower demand across the Americas has been very strong because of favorable affordability, but retailers have been hesitant to replenish inventories, because of the volatility in global prices, especially in potash with the aggressive off-season marketing from the Russians and the Belarusians. U.S. spring demand is ramping up over the next coming weeks and we believe we have reached a bottom in potash prices.', 'In Brazil, sentiment has improved. Inventories have worked their way down to much more normalized levels for both potash and phosphates, as growers take advantage of much more attractive barter ratios.', 'We estimate fertilizer shipments will total 46 million tons in 2023, up more than 10% from last year and roughly 35% of those expected shipments have already been contracted.', 'In India, phosphate inventories remain very low even after a year of elevated imports as most of the product went straight to the ground. Government subsidies for the coming fertilizer year will determine whether India will be able to attract the nutrients it needs to meet its food security concerns.', 'In Southeast Asia, potash has become much more affordable for palm oil producers as well, which should drive demand recovery.', 'Globally, we are seeing very good farmer economics and depleted inventories that suggest strong demand for phosphates and potash in 2023.', 'Given this landscape, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit from the market’s recovery. In phosphates, lingering issues from Hurricane Ian impacted our operations during the fourth quarter for longer than originally expected, but Florida operations returned to normal operating levels earlier this month. We now believe we have moved past the operational issues that impacted output and are dedicating resources to fixing key components in our production.', 'At Bartow, we are upgrading our sulfuric acid production facilities following the recent production stops we saw after Hurricane Ian. And at Faustina, we have improved operations at our ammonia plant and saw a significant increase in the amount of ammonia produced from our plant during the fourth quarter.', 'Florida production has returned to normal operating rates. During the first quarter, we expect total shipments of 1.7 million tons to 1.9 million tons with realized pricing of $625 per ton to $675 per ton. We expect stripping margins will remain relatively stable quarter-over-quarter as lower raw material prices offset lower finished product prices.', 'In our potash business, slower demand led us to temporarily stop production at our Colonsay mine, but we think the current market situation is temporary and expect to restart operations at Colonsay within the first half of 2023.', 'At Esterhazy, the 12th miner is being commissioned and the 13th miner is expected to be in service before the end of the year. When that’s done, it will add at least 1 million tons of additional annual capacity at one of the most efficient mines in the world. In the first quarter, we expect sales of 1.8 million tons to 2 million tons with realized MOP prices at the mine of $425 per ton to $475 per ton.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes had its best year since we purchased the business in 2018, with adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion in 2022, despite volatility in the second half of the year. Fourth quarter results reflect the sharp reversal of commodity prices from the highs of the first half of the year, which negatively impacted both the production and the distribution margins.', 'But for the full year, our distribution margins averaged $36 per ton, which is right in the range of $30 per ton to $40 per ton that we would expect. First quarter distribution margins will be similar to fourth quarter as higher inventory is worked through. But for the full year, we do expect distribution margins to be back within our normal range.', 'As we think about the evolution of our business, we continue to execute our high returning investments while returning capital to shareholders. In phosphates, we have begun expansion of our MicroEssentials offering by adding capacity at our Riverview facility.', 'The project is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Upon completion, about 50% of our North American phosphate business will be sales of value-added performance products. This is not an expensive project. Total budget is less than $40 million with a payback period of less than two years.', 'We are also building a test plan for purified phosphoric acid production in North America to verify final design plans for commercial operation. This is the next step in our shift away from commodity fertilizers and opens up new markets like food production and batteries. We are also exploring using the plant’s byproducts to produce NPKs.', 'In Brazil, we continue to grow our distribution business. While our footprint is already large, there are still areas where we see opportunities to expand. We have begun construction of a 1 million ton blending and distribution facility at Palmeirante in the fast growing North with access to very attractive rail infrastructure.', 'Returns of about 20% on an expected $80 million budget, make this another example of highly attractive modest investments. We are also monetizing past investments. In January, we sold our Streamsong Resort for $160 million, because we could realize appealing value for a noncore asset.', 'Our joint venture in Saudi Arabia is also performing well. In 2022, Mosaic’s equity earnings from the joint venture totaled $195 million, which is about a quarter of our initial investment. This year, they plan to reduce debt by $800 million. They have also distributed $100 million in dividends to investors. Our proportional share of $25 million was received this month.', 'Finally, I want to reiterate that we remain committed to our approach to balance sheet management and shareholder capital returns. In November, we retired $550 million in long-term debt and this allowed us to meet our commitment of reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. As we look at our balance sheet today, we believe we are well positioned for the long-term.', 'Similar to last year, we plan to return substantially all of our free cash flow to shareholders in 2023 through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. Since September of 2021, we bought back $2.2 billion in shares and we continue to see great value in our shares. To emphasize that point, we plan to proceed with a $300 million accelerated share repurchase program in the first quarter.', 'We have also grown our regular dividend to $0.80 per share and we are well positioned to consider further growth, especially with our reduced share count. In addition to the regular common dividend, our Board of Directors has approved a special dividend of $0.25 per share to be paid out on March 30th to shareholders of record on March 15th. Given our strong cash flow, combined with the proceeds of asset sales, our Board approved this payout as a supplement to our ongoing share repurchases.', 'Before we go on to Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered record results in 2022 and we expect favorable dynamics to continue in 2023. The world is short global grains and oilseeds. So farmers are incented to maximize yields.', 'We expect this to drive strong fertilizer demand and our business is well positioned to meet that demand through our existing assets and exciting new growth opportunities. With the strong cash flows that these provide, we are returning significant capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases.', 'With that, I’d like to now move on to the Q&A portion of the call.']",management_discussion,MOS_3229559

55,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thanks, Paul. Let me start by saying, we have had a year of low potash usage, which means soil levels are depleted and farmers will need to add potash to the soil to ensure reasonable yields this year.', 'So growers are seeing very attractive economics and they are acting on it. We are seeing things like our largest channel customer in North America has already got 60% of their farmer’s demand is committed for spring, which is higher than most normal years.', 'So as we move into spring, our expectation is farmer demand is going to be good, but everybody is waiting for the last moment. They don’t want to live with the price risk. So why we expect a very good season in North America and we are already seeing a good season in Brazil, we do expect people to wait as long as they feel they can, but once it moves, we expect it to move fairly well.', 'Overall, we do see the potash market as being limited by production. So while demand will be normal, we expect Russia will be exporting less than what they have in the past, probably, 1.5 million to plus 1 million tons and Belarus will probably export 6 million tons to 7 million tons, which is half of what they did pre-sanction.', 'So we think this situation today the standoff is temporary and it will start moving, and when it starts moving, we expect we will have to run hard to supply the market. Jenny, do you want to just give us a little bit of a highlight of where the overall S&D is for potash right now?']",question_answer,MOS_3229559
56,Jenny Wang,"['Sure, Joc. As you mentioned, the potash market last year declined by 16%. That was driven by the supply constraint, and this year, with a very constructive farm economics. In the markets like North America and South America, we believe farmers have all the incentive to go back to apply potash on the field to maximize their yield.', 'For the markets like China and India, the government they are concerned to the full security. Therefore, there are a lot of local policies to support the farmers to maximize their production. For that, we actually have seen potash demand increased last year in China. We believe this trend is going to continue.', 'So, overall, in 2023, we expect the demand to rebound globally, but there’s no way to have the full recovery back to 2021, just because of the supply is constrained. We are seeing 5 million tons to 6 million tons of supply shortage in this market.']",question_answer,MOS_3229559

58,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thanks, Paul. Now if we look at the second half of 2022, it reflects a reversal in prices from the first half of the year. This impacted both our distribution and our production business. In our production business, we are now working our way through high cost raw materials such as sulfur and ammonia. As those move through the system, we expect our margins to get more normalized after the first quarter. In distribution, high cost inventory is now working its way through the system.', 'Now, none of this should have come as much of a surprise because prices were moving up in the first half and coming back down in the second half of the year. So, in the first half of the year, we made higher distribution margins, and in the second half of the year, those reversed as we were selling higher-priced inventory into the market.', 'If we look at it over a whole year, both our production business and our distribution business did very well, and overall, 2022 was a very successful year and a record year for the Fertilizantes business.', 'Once we get past the first quarter, distribution margins should be in line with our historical expectations of $30 per ton to $40 per ton, and our production margins will revert to normal stripping margins well once we work through the high cost raw materials.']",question_answer,MOS_3229559

60,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you. First of all, let me say, the last couple of years, there have been some extraordinary circumstances that have impacted our production, particularly in our phosphate business and our Brazil businesses.', 'First, sulfur shortages coming out of the Gulf of Mexico has hurt us at the start of last year, refinery shutdowns, COVID, transportation limitations at the start of last year, and then, of course, a couple of big hurricanes, one that hit Louisiana and the other one last year, which hit directly onto our operations here in Florida.', 'Now, what we saw from those was damage that, probably, lingered longer than we would have liked, because of the condition of some of our plants. So what are we doing to improve that? We are looking at how do we fortify our plants to make them more resilient to this type of occurrence. And some of that means we have replaced a bunch of our converters in sulfuric acid, our boilers or economizers, et cetera. In Brazil, we are building a new sulfur tank, new phosphoric acid tanks are being overhauled. So we are doing a lot of work to really fortify and reinforce the resilience of these plants.', 'So where do we expect these to go? What we have seen already is, for instance, where we have done the repair work at Faustina, in Louisiana, more than 40% of our ammonia last quarter was supplied from Faustina, which is the highest it’s been in over a couple of years. So we think we are getting ahead of all of that.', 'Now if I look forward, what do I expect? I expect that we will be running in that 85% to 90% of our 10-K value. So that would probably indicate somewhere in the range of 7.5 million tons to 8 million tons in phosphates and 3.5 million tons in our Brazilian business.']",question_answer,MOS_3229559

My question for you is, does the world really not need 70 million tons of potash or could there be an impact on global crop production this year as a result of this and/or do you think there could be maybe a bit of a panic to meet farmer demand this spring given the just in time purchasing mentality?']",question_answer,MOS_3229559

So we are actually shorting some regions, Africa and parts of Asia, because they can’t afford it and even some of Central America.', 'So the reality is, if there was more potash, it would certainly find a home, and obviously, the price sensitivity would be different as it is today. We expect the major markets that can afford will bid up the potash price and that will be what drives that. So I am going to hand it over to Jenny to just talk a little bit about that balance.']",question_answer,MOS_3229559
65,Jenny Wang,"['Yeah. Sure. Thanks, Joc. Steve, to your question, what is the impact with a significant demand of shipment reduction last year, we believe that was over 11 million tons versus the previous year. We believe the impact to the yield in some of the markets might be reflected on the yield for that year and in some markets like North America and Brazil, where the farmers probably have invested in the potash application.', 'In the previous year, they probably they were able to afford for reducing rate for a year, but in two years in a row to cut application rate, it is not really a good decision for the farmers to maximize their yield and production. Therefore, we believe the demand recovery of the demand for potash in this market are there. It’s just the farmers have the incentive to maximize their production.', 'There are certain markets, as I mentioned in the prerecorded answer, government are really supporting the farmers to use potash in order to secure their food security and we believe that government support are going to continue as we are getting into 2023.', 'Lastly on the spring demand, what we heard from our customers and also the growers on the ground, Steve, in North America, in particular, there’s a very clear desire based on the affordability and the farm economics that farmers to go back to apply potash, especially for those who skipped a season last year or cut the rate last year.', 'We are at the stage that, the farmers need to engage with their retailers and then the retailers to cover the last part of the buying from us and we see that is happening. In fact, this week, we are seeing increasing inquiries in the south part of the U.S. as the season started.', 'So we feel confident that demand is going to recover for potash we still believe with a significant constraint on supply and the price will stay at a healthy level, although, it is much more moderated from last year.']",question_answer,MOS_3229559

So we have gone from 500,000 equivalents to 1 million equivalents and even if that goes to1.5 million equivalent to 2 million equivalent, we are going to see a heck of a lot of displaced phosphates out -- not getting out of China. So that’s the reason we feel fairly confident that our expectation for exports is reasonable.', 'In terms of our own, we are not supplying any of that market at this stage. We are in the process of doing a pilot study now. We have done the -- this tabletop work and we are now doing a pilot plant to get the design criteria and the costing for our own purified phosphoric acid and I would expect to be saying more about that in the next six months or so and we will be talking about making an economic decision after that.']",question_answer,MOS_3229559

And what we expect for the year is, I think, what we are seeing is we are seeing an increase in refinery activity, which is leading to a better supply of sulfur and probably making the sulfur market a little looser. But if DAP demand goes up a lot, that could tighten again, but again, that sort of sets itself out with price.', 'And then on ammonia, what we are seeing is a big decline in the price of natural gas in Europe and that price of natural gas, of course, is driving down the price of natural gas here in the U.S. and also driving down the price of our nitrogen inputs.', 'So our expectation is that that will continue and then flatten, so we will continue to decrease for a while and then it’s probably getting close to flattening now where you have got I think urea prices are down in that $300 range and it can’t really go that much lower than that or you will start seeing production slow down again.', 'So we expect that to happen and we expect that -- over the year, stripping margins are actually going to be quite flat for us.

So is the implication then that, if you are able to ship, I think, you heard 7.5 million tons to 8 million tons of product in 2023 or that would be the current kind of plan as you would sit here today with flat stripping margins that the EBIT -- you think your EBITDA is growing in phosphate?

Our volume, I think, is -- that’s not an unreasonable expectation for volume. The question was in respect to what our production capabilities were.', 'So I will qualify that and say that our -- we always are driven by what is the on the ground demand for our product and not necessarily what our production capabilities are. So there could be a gap between what our production capabilities are in our sales, but that will depend. Likely, this year, we expect for both potash and phosphate demand will be good. So we expect to sell most of what we make. So that’s not an unreasonable assumption.', 'In terms of the pricing, yeah, our expectation is that, as the season gets moving, both phosphates and potash prices should move up at least somewhat, and I think in the case of potash, it could move up a lot, but certainly in phosphates. But we expect that phosphates will kind of balance off with a relatively flat stripping margin, if you will. So that’s our basic prediction of where that would go.', 'In terms of Brazil, I would say that, both the production business and the distribution business have been equally impacted. One, by rising raw material costs and the other by just the timing of sales versus purchases of third-party material.

That slowed down significantly in the third quarter and fourth quarter, which was less than what we would expect. So reasonably we shutdown Colonsay.', 'Now like I said earlier, we shut it down. We still have the employees. We still have everything ready to go. So it doesn’t take much to restart. But what’s happened in the meantime that has to be considered is, we have added since that time and because of the slowdown, we have been able to add two new miners at Esterhazy. So very soon, Esterhazy will have an incremental capacity of 1 million tons.', 'So if you add the 1.3-ish million ton run rate of Colonsay plus 1 million tons of Esterhazy, it doesn’t seem to me that we are going to need the second mill at Colonsay.

We are not going to refill until we need it and then we want to end the season empty. So that’s our expectation, that’s what they will do. But that also means that the summer fill program should be strong here in North America.', 'In Brazil, I think the -- because of the long lead time for everything, it will be a little different than that and I think the Brazil market will be more stable throughout the year and we will see the normal pattern of third quarter being our strongest quarter and like we have said here, even the Safrinha season we are starting to see some pretty strong demand signals at least.', 'So we think that will continue. We think third quarter will be pretty normal with the U.S. fill. And then the one you have got to consider is, at some point, we need to see and we expect to see Central America, China, India, Asia, the potash going to the Indonesia and Malaysia, we expect all that has to ramp up because they have got a year where they just haven’t used the products they need.

Adjusted earnings per share was $3.22, and adjusted EBITDA was $1.7 billion. These results are driving significant cash flow generation, which is allowing us to return significant capital to shareholders while also continuing to invest in the business and strengthen the balance sheet.', 'During the quarter, we returned roughly $670 million to shareholders, including $600 million of share buybacks.', 'Now, before diving into our operations, I’d like to address current market dynamics. Food security remains a concern around the world. Global grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios remain at 20-year lows, and early data continues to suggest there may be further downside to total production, once the fall harvest is complete.', 'It is important to remember that the market was tight when the year began, well before the start of the war, and issues over the last several months have further exacerbated the situation. Ukraine’s production shortfall is significant, but weather issues like high temperatures and drought conditions in other major growing regions are having an even bigger impact on an already tight market.', 'In the U.S., weather delayed spring planting, and the compressed planting window reduced nutrient applications. The growing season was further impacted by high temperatures and drought in some areas. Weather tends to be a significant factor in yield, but under-fertilization doesn’t help, and you can only mine the soil for so long. Both are contributing to an expectation of weaker-than-normal North American harvest. And this was reflected in the most recent USDA yield forecast.', 'In Brazil, fertilizer shipments appear poised to have dropped around 10% year-over-year. And La Niña remains a threat despite the market counting on record-breaking corn and soybean production. Beyond grains and oilseeds, we’re seeing food security issues play out in other crops as well. Staples like rice are also seeing significant production shortages, driving some countries like India to restrict exports.', 'Because of this, we see a tight market for global grains and oilseeds continuing into 2023 and beyond. The global fertilizer market remains tight with supply constraints in both potash and phosphate still unresolved. Global potash supply remains impacted by the significant reduction in Belarusian exports, which we think will be down 8 million tons in 2022. Of the 4 million tons they will export this year, we estimate about 2 million tons were shipped in the first quarter before the sanctions and Lithuania’s decision to prevent Belarus from using its ports.', 'Belarus exports are down significantly from the first quarter, and we do not expect much recovery through the rest of the year or for most of 2023. This means the market will continue to be short of potash in 2023. The phosphate market is also impacted by supply constraints. China production is down because of environmental concerns, and exports are being restricted to ensure domestic availability and affordability.', 'This year, we expect China’s phosphate exports will be down by up to 5 million tons. Those restrictions could extend through at least the first half of 2023 and possibly beyond as China prioritizes securing domestic food supply and meeting growing industrial demand.', 'While global channel inventories of phosphate and potash remain below historic norms, certain regions, especially in the areas where we do most of our business, saw inventories build in the first half of the year. But prices have retreated back to levels low enough to entice growers to step back into the market. We expect inventories to continue working lower through the end of the year and into early 2023.', 'U.S. fall application has been trending back towards normal levels. We believe we could end the season with inventory significantly depleted, especially for phosphates. The U.S. is also experiencing low water levels on the Mississippi River, which is delaying supply coming through New Orleans.', 'In Brazil, the higher-priced inventory built during the first half of the year has slowed third quarter shipments, but sentiment is improving. Prices have retreated enough to encourage sales, and we expect inventories will end the year much the same as where they started. The barter ratio suggests we’re approaching a much more constructive environment for demand.', 'In India, importers are taking advantage of the price pullback in phosphates. India’s phosphates inventory is still low, while farmer demand remains strong. Government subsidies remain at a level that is supportive of phosphate imports but are likely to leave the country short of adequate supply of potash.', 'To summarize, the strength of crop prices and more affordable fertilizer prices suggest nutrient demand will recover from the summer lull we experienced during the third quarter. Given the constructive ag backdrop, we believe our business is well positioned to benefit.', 'In our phosphates business, Hurricane Ian forced us to shut down operations late in the third quarter, which delayed shipments at the end of September. Our team performed admirably and was able to get our Florida operations back up and running quickly following the hurricane. We estimate the shortfall in production to be in the range of 200,000 tons.', 'Looking forward, we now expect fourth quarter sales to be in the range of 1.7 million to 2 million tons. Our phosphate business is expected to benefit from lower raw material prices in the fourth quarter, particularly as low sulfur prices start flowing through our costs. We expect a fourth quarter benefit of $40 to $45 per ton from lower raw materials in our North American phosphate business over the cost in the third quarter.', 'In our potash business, we are realizing the benefits of improved volumes from Esterhazy and from the addition of Colonsay. 11 of the 13 planned miners are now running at Esterhazy, and improved operating rates at Colonsay together are driving higher volumes. We anticipate some turnarounds during the fourth quarter that will impact total production but expect sales volumes to be 2 million to 2.2 million tons.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes continues to be a very good business, having earned $1.2 billion in EBITDA over the last 12 months. High inventories built during the second quarter led to slower than initially expected demand during the third quarter as shipments typically seen during quarter three didn’t materialize. But pricing trends towards the end of the third quarter reached a level that is beginning to drive shipments, and we’ve begun seeing that in our business. Some of the third quarter buyer hesitancy is impacting the fourth quarter, but we expect trends to begin normalizing as we finish out the year.', 'Before moving on, I’d like to address the next iteration of our transformation process. Over the last three years, we’ve extracted significant cost efficiencies in Brazil, lowered our cost profile in the potash business with transition to Esterhazy K3 and benefited from the combination of support functions across North America.', 'Our next area of focus is the realization of efficiencies through a digital transformation of how we manage our business. In our release last night, we introduced our global digital acceleration project, an initiative that will transform how we use data to manage a complex business across our global footprint. This effort will upgrade our core systems and allow for more seamless integration across sales, production, supply chain and global support functions.', 'Over the next several years, the total cost will be about $200 million to $250 million, split roughly evenly between SG&A and capital expenditures. As a result of this transformation, we expect to realize significant benefits in our sales and production planning and our cost and capital management. Similar to our early transformation efforts, this initiative will continue the trend of adding shareholder value.

The farm economics have been very strong this year with the support from their government. The monsoon has also been helpful as we see demand increases, especially for phosphate. The recently announced subsidy program from the Indian government has been very supportive to their phosphate input and also consumption. We are seeing steady buy-ins from Indian customers on DAP recently at $750 per ton level.', 'With the strong demand in Q4 and getting into 2023, we continue to see the supply constraints for both, phosphate and potash. On phosphate, we expect that Chinese export control will continue as we get into 2023 as the Chinese government to ensure the domestic supply availability and their farmers to be able to get fertilizers for their food production. And there’s very little new capacities coming online in phosphate production in 2023.', 'Similarly to potash, we envision Belarus and Russia’s supply will remain constrained in 2023.

Since the war started in the first quarter, a lot of Brazilian customers rushed to buy products from all around the world in order to ensure their supply. As a result of this rush buying, we are seeing a very high inventory building at port in Brazil started in July. That inventory at port has gradually slowed down over the last few months. By end of October, we are saying that inventory export has come down by 35% versus the peak in end of July.', 'The other thing that I want to mention is the import shipments to Brazil. In the mid of the year, the vessels coming to Brazil had to wait for over eight weeks to unload product because the ports warehouses are so full. Now, the waiting time has come down to less than two weeks. That’s a signal. And in the meantime, we are seeing re-export vessels for both potash and phosphate.

So yes, we absolutely will expand the capacity of Esterhazy’s K3 mine to meet the capacity of the mill. In terms of Colonsay, we see an immediate need for those tons as the gap in supply from Belarus has meant there’s been an opportunity for us and through Canpotex exporting more product. That near-term need, we expect, will continue into 2023. So, we certainly see a need for Colonsay in the near term. Bringing that production on has been relatively inexpensive, likely in the range of $50 per capacity ton. So on that basis, that’s paid off over a matter of months.', 'So, how will we look at it as we go forward? We will always be focused on working towards value, not volume.

If I think about 2023, starting with potash, and we’ve been saying this, and with the lack of -- or the lack of sales coming out of Belarus, we do see that the market is going to have to ration supply, which does, as you mentioned, bring up an opportunity for us to potentially move more product.', 'I will say that North America, we expect to stay relatively flat. It’s not a high-growth market. So, this is all an export opportunity, if you will.', 'The challenges there are twofold. One is, do we get to the right markets that really need it? And then the other question is, can we even move it? So, those are the first points. The supply chain is at its limit right now, and we struggle to get the tons out, particularly say in the first quarter, which I think everyone sees problems getting product out of Canada in the first quarter with winter and all the rest.', 'And then, it comes down to what’s the production capacity. We have, I think, developed real great flexibility there with Esterhazy now reaching what I would call its full capacity, bringing on Colonsay to augment that capacity and give us some flexibility so that we can hit the seasonality as well as the increased demand. So, I think we’re well positioned there.', 'I can’t give you a specific number at this stage of what we think the year is going to bring for demand. But I mean we’re looking at a global market of 64 million tons next year in potash, up probably a little bit off this year. I think this year, we might have been as low as 62 million tons. So, we do see an improvement in the market. We see the rush of tons that came in the first quarter from Russia and Belarus are probably not coming, though a good opportunity for us in that first and second quarter, certainly of next year and then throughout the year.', 'In terms of phosphates, we’re probably a little more production-limited in phosphates. I mean, we’re running those assets. But between the limitations of the resource base, whatnot, we don’t have an expansion opportunity really there. So, we expect that to stay similar in that sort of 8 million to -- maybe 8.5 million, 9 million tons of capacity. How well we utilize those will depend on the market. And so, our expectation is our utilization will be quite high next year.

So in other words, it was costing them a lot more of their production to buy the inputs than it had in previous years. So, I think there’s a risk if you go too high in price that you will actually start really destroying demand.', 'So look, I think there is a great opportunity for a -- at the same reasonable barter ratios as we’ve had with elevated crop prices that we can have very good margins and that the market should be able to move up from here.

The supply disruption in China, while we believe will continue through 2023 or the export restrictions out of China, we expect those to continue. But that’s 5 million-ish tons on a 70-something million ton market, where in potash, you’re talking about a 8 million-ton decline on a 70 million-ton market. So, as you think about it from that perspective, the problems in Belarus in terms of exports are, A, less likely to be resolved; and B, more significant to the overall market.

One is where the product comes from. So obviously, running Colonsay at a little higher cost. The other thing that we have to take into account is Belle Plaine is highly dependent on the price of natural gas. It uses arguably some 30 million MMBtus per year of natural gas.', 'So, if you add a couple of dollars to the natural gas price, it has a pretty big impact on that operation. So, other than that though, as you mentioned, the potash pricing or the potash cost is pretty stable.', 'If we then look at phosphates -- and quite frankly, we are seeing some inflation in both, mining costs and processing. Mining, the distances are getting longer. The grades probably over the years is declining slightly. So, you’ve got some costs in there that come up. But they pale in comparison to when you look at the raw materials. If we think about $1,000 ammonia, that represents $200 on the cost of a ton of phosphates. If you think about a $400 sulfur, that represents about $180 cost on top. So, you could have -- at the peak, there was probably $420 a ton in our -- or sorry, $380 a ton in our phosphate cost just on those two raw materials. Now they’ve retracted back to $100 for sulfur and our average -- I think our average ammonia cost is now in the range of $600, if you take into account our own production and all the rest.

But there’s no question from -- in general, that phosphate rock mining in China has been restricted greatly because of its proximity to the Yangtze River.

So, if anything, I would argue that China is probably somewhat resource-constrained from a phosphate rock process.

And normally, we try and keep our positions fairly balanced, but you tend to take a position as much as a couple of months ahead of when you sell.', 'So, if you are in a declining market and you buy in July and you sell in September, you tend to take that price risk for those two months. If the prices are going up, you have extraordinary -- or you have gains in that positioning. And if it’s -- if the prices are going down, you have losses in that positioning.', 'So, if we look at Brazil right now, you are seeing that. We had very good margins in quarter two that reversed to some extent in quarter three. Although as I said in the earlier comments, the margins are still looking pretty strong. And I think I would credit that with our product management teams not only globally, but in Brazil, specifically, who are able to understand the market dynamic, decide how far ahead or how late they want to address the pricing and how much inventory they’re holding.', 'So, I mean, there’s a great art to that as a production company. However, there’s limitations on how much of that you can really do. So, I think that answers most of what you asked there, Andrew.']",question_answer,MOS_1201164

Who knows what happens with EuroChem. It would seem that Nutrien can’t place all those tons.', 'So, I guess I’m trying to figure out, I don’t if you have an answer, but how do you think about all this?

However, let me say how we view the market. Like I said, we see next year that that 8 million tons won’t come back, yes. I’m sure ICL will try and push out what they can. I’m sure EuroChem seems to be reasonably effective in getting to market.', 'I will say that Uralkali seems to be not as active in the market this year as previous, and there’s been a couple of rumors and whatnot about why. But I can’t tell you that. That would be, again, a question for them. What -- and the Belarusians, as long as they can get product through the Lithuanian ports, they’re going to be restricted to either a long-rail haul to St. Petersburg, assuming they can get port capacity there or a long and complicated rail haul to China, which they have done relatively successfully. I think they’ve probably been able to move 1.5 million-ish tons to China through that rail link, so.', 'But with all of that together, we see a supply side -- even with extra tons from Canpotex, we see a supply side of -- in the range of 64 million tons. And from our perspective, if -- the market will have to find a way to be at that 64 million tons. So in other words, we think there’s good need -- or there’s need for all the Colonsay tons next year.', 'What happens beyond that? Who knows? Again, I will emphasize with Colonsay, it cost us virtually a couple of months’ production to restart it.

Adjusted earnings per share were $3.64 and adjusted EBITDA was $2 billion. Free cash flow totaled $794 million, allowing us to return $667 million to shareholders during the second quarter, including $612 million of share repurchases, bringing the year-to-date buyback total through June 30th to over $1 billion.', ""We've continued to buy back shares aggressively through July because we believe our portfolio positions us to continue driving strong results and generating significant cash flow through the rest of the year and into 2023. As such, Mosaic's Board of Directors has approved a new $2 billion share repurchase authorization to begin once the current one is exhausted later this year."", ""Before digging deeper into our business, let's discuss the broader agricultural markets. There are several issues threatening global food security. The war in Ukraine continues to create uncertainty around food supply from one of the world's most important crop producers."", 'In addition, Europe and US have experienced very high temperatures, while Southern Brazil is showing signs of drought conditions. And all of this is happening at a time of lower overall nutrient applications because of constrained supply.', 'Each of these issues alone can have a material effect on global crop production. But together, the risk to food security is significant. This suggests global stock-to-use ratios, which are already near 20-year lows, will remain under pressure. Because of this, we see a tight supply and demand scenario for global grains and oilseeds continuing through 2022 and into 2023.', 'As we focus on the potash and phosphate fertilizer markets, the fundamentals remain quite strong.', 'In potash, we continue to expect Belarusian exports to be down 8 million tonnes this year. Some of that will be mitigated by incremental supply from producers like Mosaic over the next 18 months. But that will not be enough to erase the deficit that we see lasting well into 2023 at least.', 'In phosphates, China has continued to restrict exports as it prioritizes domestic industrial and agricultural demand. We now believe full year phosphate exports from China could be down as much as 5 million tonnes from the prior year total of 11.5 million tonnes.', ""Shifting focus, we believe global fertilizer demand in the first half of 2022 was down about 10% from the same period last year, which aligns with the shortfall we've seen in supply. Grower sentiment has grown more cautious. But supply constraints are supporting global prices and margins well above historical levels, a situation we believe will continue at least through the rest of the year."", ""North America and Brazil have been well supplied thus far in '22, but much of the rest of the world is continuing to see unfilled demand of both phosphates and potash as a result of limited supply. In North America, a compressed planting season, macroeconomic headwinds and volatile crop prices impact spring season consumption. First half applications were down from the record year in 2021, but remained in-line with historic levels."", 'Looking forward, we expect normal demand leading up to fall application. In Brazil, we saw first half demand in-line with historic levels. Channel inventories were built in country by importers driven by concerns over supply availability stemming from geopolitical events.', ""Significant customer prepays, though, indicate farmer demand will ramp up as the softer season gets underway. In India, we've begun to see importers enter the market and take advantage of the recent price pullback in phosphate. India's phosphate inventories are low and concerns over availability persist."", 'Farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong and the government continues to indicate it will ensure adequate supply for domestic consumption. In China, port inventories of potash sit below 2 million tonnes and in Southeast Asia, shipments of potash appear below historic levels. We see these dynamics impacting demand beyond 2022 as reduced application this year will require a catch-up in future years when supply availability improves.', ""As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain optimistic. The investments we've made over the last decade have positioned us well for today's environment. In Brazil, our 2018 acquisition of the Fertilizantes business has driven significant shareholder value. We've seen EBITDA grow from less than $70 million in proforma 2017 to $1.2 billion over the last 12 months. And we've completely recapitalized the business, having now bought back all of the shares issued and repaid all of the borrowing to fund that deal."", ""Looking forward, Mosaic, Fertilizantes will continue to benefit from its market position as the country's largest producer and second-largest distributor. We are seeing inflation in our cost structure, but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact."", ""In potash, we are realizing the benefits of K3, one of the world's most efficient potash mines and we're actively working to optimize that asset. We've reached our initial operating run rate target of 5.5 million tonnes per year at the end of the first quarter and plan to continue our optimization of the complex with the addition of three new underground miners over the next year, resulting in an incremental 1 million tonnes of production capacity."", ""At Colonsay, we've begun the process of restarting the second mill, which should expand output to 2 million tonnes per year by the second half of 2023. In phosphates, we continue to benefit from our advantaged position in ammonia and we're now seeing an improvement in sulfur costs that should begin to flow through to our production costs later this year."", ""We've seen prices moderate down to levels we believe are sustainable for the rest of the year. As a result, we expect our stripping margins will remain well above historic levels."", 'Given the outlook for our business and the free cash flow we expect to generate, capital allocation remains a key focus for us. First, we continue to invest in our business. For 2022, total capital expenditures remain unchanged at $1.3 billion. We remain open to modest, high-returning projects, and small bolt-on acquisitions, especially in Brazil, but we are not interested in large-scale greenfield projects.', ""Second, we're committed to ensuring a strong balance sheet and plan to retire $550 million of long-term debt in the second half of 2022, after which, we see no need to further deleverage."", ""The third pillar of our strategy is returning capital to shareholders. Year-to-date, we returned $1.1 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends and we expect that pace to continue, if not accelerate, as the year progresses. In total, we expect to return essentially 100% of our free cash flow after the commitments to the business and the balance sheet we've discussed."", ""Because we're approaching the end of our current authorization, our Board of Directors approved a new authorization of $2 billion that begins once we've exhausted the current authorization."", ""At today's valuation, buying back our own shares provides better economics than any other use of cash. So, we expect to take advantage of this as long as the opportunity remains. We may also consider supplementing share repurchases with special dividends over time depending on market conditions. As we've said in the past, we will not build cash on the balance sheet just for the sake of it."", ""Before going into Q&A, allow me to summarize. Mosaic delivered very strong results in the second quarter and we expect favorable dynamics as we continue through the year and into 2023. We're continuing to help the world grow the food it needs by ensuring customer demands are met, and we're returning significant capital to shareholders, while still investing in the business and strengthening our balance sheet."", 'Now, with that, I would like to move on to the Q&A portion of the call.']",management_discussion,MOS_591416

163,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Paul. Let's start with potash. The Belarusian and Russian exports together we expect to be down by about 12 million tonnes this year due to the effect of sanctions.

So we expect between the two of them, like I said at the start, 12 million tonnes."", ""In phosphates, the biggest player, of course, is China in terms of export restrictions, and those have been extended into the second half of the year. Our projection for Chinese exports this year is down to seven-ish million tonnes from 11.5 million tonnes. So we're seeing a good five million tonne reduction of exports."", ""And again, because of the structural changes in China, we really don't expect them to come back in a big way even after the restrictions end.

165,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Let me start by saying, because of the lack of supply in both phosphates and potash, demand had to be rationed. And what we saw was that rationing of demand meant lower use in different areas, but specifically lack of supply in some areas. So it's very regional how this played out."", 'In North America particularly, a compressed season because of weather in the spring led to very late and very limited ability to add fertilizer to ground. So this, combined with growers being willing to mine their soil because of the higher prices, probably led to lower use in the United States and Canada. But remember, any of this missed or curtailed application will have to be made up in the next couple of seasons. So we do expect a very robust normal fall application.', 'Now again, caveat there being, it will be late because the planting was late, so the harvest will be late. So it could cross quarters from the third quarter into the fourth quarter. But if I look at the overall second half of the year, we expect it to be very much in line with a normal year here in the and in Canada.']",question_answer,MOS_591416
166,Paul Massoud,"['Joc, we received a few questions on elevated inventory levels in Brazil, specifically around potash. How do you think this will affect new sales? And how might this also impact pricing?']",question_answer,MOS_591416
167,Joc O'Rourke,"['Thank you. As we discuss Brazil, we have to start by understanding that 85% of fertilizer into Brazil is imported. And at the start of the year, there was a huge concern with the constrained supply over whether or not the country could get the fertilizer it needed for its planting.', 'To put it to a point, the Minister of Agriculture and the President of the country both travel the world to ensure that imports would be available for Brazil. As such, Brazil led pricing in the first half of the year for around the world.', 'Now because of that, imports were up about 30% year-over-year in the first half. So as we move into the second half of the year, inventories are high. And because inventories are high, farmers believe they can defer. But ultimately, solid economics for both soybeans and second crop corn are going to drive the farmer to apply fertilizer. And when they start applying, we believe the ramp-up of buying activity will consume the inventory, and we will end the year at a normal place. The best evidence from our perspective of this is the high prepay that we have seen in the last quarter, which indicates that the farmers are getting ready to buy, the farmers are getting ready to apply. They are just waiting for the right time.']",question_answer,MOS_591416
168,Paul Massoud,"['We received a few questions from analysts about our third quarter sales volume guidance, especially for phosphates. Can you provide some context around our expectations for both potash and phosphates over the next three months?']",question_answer,MOS_591416
169,Joc O'Rourke,"['Yes. Thank you. Let me start by saying this is mostly a timing issue. In North America, the late spring and late planting is going to lead to a late harvest. Now that means that the second half demand, while it should be in line with expectation, could come in the fourth quarter rather than the third quarter due to this delayed harvest. So while we expect a very normal second half, where exactly it plays out in terms of the timing is yet to be seen.', ""In Brazil, planting for the second crop corn or the soybeans won't happen until November, December. As such, there is time for them to delay their purchases until the last minute. Now again, in Brazil, just like North America, we expect normal application in the second half of the year. But as always, with higher prices, people are deferring the purchase as late as they can."", 'However, good economics will mean that in both cases, we believe normal application will occur. If you do note the high range for the phosphate guidance does align with more typical sales historically, but again, we could see those slipping into the fourth quarter.']",question_answer,MOS_591416
170,Paul Massoud,"['Clint, this question is for you. We received a question on our working capital needs in the last few quarters. How do you see that playing out going forward?']",question_answer,MOS_591416
171,Clint Freeland,"['Thanks, Paul, and good morning, everyone. As we look at working capital, there are a number of dynamics to keep in mind. First, the overall market pricing levels and seasonality that impact our income statement also impact our balance sheet, particularly around working capital.', ""As we've seen the pricing levels and the overall market increase over the last couple of years, that has caused an increase in our core working capital accounts of receivables, inventories and payables. So those tend to follow directionally what's happening with the overall pricing environment. And again, over the last couple of years as a result of that, we've seen the overall working capital needs of the business increase."", ""Now in addition to the impact of the pricing environment that we're operating in, we also have the seasonality of our business that plays out. And so you see some meaningful changes from quarter-to-quarter based on which season we're either in or entering into. First quarter, we tend to see preparation for the spring season. So we typically see inventory builds. We typically see our accruals and payables from the previous year get paid out. And then as we move into the second quarter, we tend to see receivables build. We tend to see other impacts of -- on working capital. So we can see as we move through the seasons it certainly will play out in our working capital accounts, particularly the seasons in the – in North America and Brazil."", 'Two things, I think, are good to focus on or to recall, particularly as it relates to Brazil. One is our growing distribution business in Brazil does tend to hold quite a bit of inventory, particularly as it moves into the season, and then it tends to liquidate throughout the season. So that can be a driver of some of our overall working capital.', ""The other element of the Brazil business is around prepayments. Prepayments tend to build in the first half of the year and then reverse out in the second half of the year. And just to give you a sense of order of magnitude, first half of this year, we saw prepayments in Brazil increase by about $830 million. Again, that's another factor that's influenced by the overall pricing environment. But again, we would expect to see the vast majority of that, if not all of it, reverse out in the back half of the year. And specifically, in the third quarter, I would expect somewhere between 50% to 75% of that number to reverse out of working capital. So again, just keep in mind, as you look at our working capital, overall pricing environment impacts it, but also the seasonality of our underlying business.""]",question_answer,MOS_591416

Joc, you mentioned you were looking at potentially some small bolt-ons down there. What businesses are you largely looking at? And can you also comment on how the gross margins in that business differ between product you produce versus product that you buy and then redistribute? Do you see that split changing going forward as perhaps you expand your capacities?""]",question_answer,MOS_591416
175,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Okay. Thanks, Steve. Look, let me start by saying, probably as we look at Brazil, the Northwest or Northeast kind of section of Brazil, as you go towards, but not into the Amazon, obviously. It seems to be the area that’s growing the fastest. It's growing probably at 10% plus per year. We have plans to build a hub that would allow us to be more participative in that region."", ""So as that market grows, that's one area where we would expect to expand our distribution business. And then in the areas of production, we've got plans for optimizing our existing operations. We're looking at plans to expand and extend the life of our potash facility down there because we think it's a niche area where it can supply."", ""So, there's a number of opportunities we're looking at down there that we think are going to have very quick paybacks and relatively limited capital requirements. In terms of the margins, clearly producer margins are better at this type of market than distribution margins."", ""But on the other hand, the benefit of our distribution business is that the margins stay very constant year-on-year. Where we – what I'll say, though, not to be too explicit about our actual margin split is that, our best margins are seen for things like MicroEssentials, where we pick up the production margin in the US and then both the distribution and retail margin down in Brazil."", 'So those margins are pretty fantastic and then the other place where the margins are really good is our production B2B business, where we sell it through our own distribution and we capture both of those margins. So -- but overall, I think our -- right now, our -- two-thirds of our earnings are probably being driven by the production business.']",question_answer,MOS_591416

As we think about capital allocation, really, our thoughts on that have been reasonably consistent, which we've made a commitment a long time to go to pay the $550 million down to make the $1 billion of payments. But once that's done, we believe that's done. We've got a very strong balance sheet. We're comfortable."", ""Obviously, we have to do our capital. And that brings us down to the question you're asking, which is how are we going to distribute the rest. And as I said just earlier, we expect to give that all back to shareholders. We don't see anything more enticing than our own business right now. So we expect that certainly at these types of share prices and our types of EBITDA-to-enterprise value ratios, we think our shares are very compelling, and we'll continue to buy those."", ""Now, if that -- if the price of our shares changes or the business changes, then we may make a decision to move towards some level of special dividends. But recognize that just says that we originally intended to have more of a balance. The special dividend would support or be in favor of the long-term holders who don't intend to sell their shares. So, in some respects, I want to serve all of our shareholders. And so that might be something they would like. So, that would be the reason for that."", ""In terms of regular dividends, we've made the decision that we would look at the regular dividend basically annually. And so our thought was we would leave that till the end of the year. But look, our share count is lower, our debt level is lower. So, we have less money going out for -- on a total on a dividend basis today than we had a year ago. And obviously, we have less debt repayment to make so -- or less interest payments to make.

Lucas, I think that actually has a fairly simple explanation, which is as we have integrated our B2B business and our B2C business, we've tried to focus on selling our B2B product through our own distribution sales system. And so because of that, that is an intercompany transfer and doesn't count towards -- we don't -- we try not to double count the volumes. So, I suspect what you're looking at there is, although purchased nutrient volumes were down, that's because they were replaced by internal volumes from our own B2B business, if you will, or our production business.""]",question_answer,MOS_591416

And likewise, so will nitrogen."", ""I don't know if that would stop people from using or make people use less phosphate. I suspect you would still try to use the right amount of the fertilizers. I know that, obviously, the optimum ratio is best, but -- I guess it's like vitamins. Not having enough vitamin D wouldn't mean you wouldn't want to have enough vitamin C, if you will. So it's probably beyond my agronomic understanding to know if that would have a thing. But we're not looking at any kind of restricted sales because of others."", 'The one thing I will acknowledge on that, though, is if the price of nitrogen gets so high that it takes up a lot of the budget that has historically been a problem for the other nutrients in countries like India, where they tend to over-apply nitrogen.

And I know you talked a bit earlier about the volumes improving in the back half. But more holistically, just what would it take for you -- the operating rates in your US phosphate business to get back over 85%? They haven't been there in some time. Just trying to -- is it just demand? Is it logistics issues in Florida? I'm just trying to get a sense of -- it seems like there's a lot of under-absorbed overhead and idled and turnaround costs that you're absorbing here that are maybe leading to cost and margins not as robust as they could be?""]",question_answer,MOS_591416
198,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Yeah. Thanks, Adam. Look, I saw that you had asked that question in your pre-stuff, and I was thinking about it a little bit. If I look back the last couple of years, we've had a freeze in Texas that restricted sulfur use, which actually restricted our ability to run. We had Hurricane Ida, which knocked out power in Louisiana for, I think, three or four weeks, et cetera."", ""And if I look at -- and then first quarter of this year -- so we went into the first quarter this year -- so we went into the first quarter this year with low inventory in phosphates. Then we had rail restrictions -- unbelievable rail restrictions. And so while we've built up inventory, it's been very difficult to move the product and hard to -- we've been low on sulfur. Now we're high on sulfur, but it's our turnaround quarter come -- that we've just gone through. And so now as we get there, I am hoping that there's no external factors that continue to push against our southern US location, if you will, and that should be what it takes to get us back to normal."", ""There hasn't been any big internal things that have slowed us down. It's been more of this damage from the hurricane, damage from the ice storms and then -- or not damage, sorry, restrictions from the ice storms, logistics.

201,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Yes. Thanks, Michael. In terms of Ma'aden, our second quarter equity earnings were about $34 million. Our sales attributed to the business was 413,000 tonnes. So while not quite up to what it is ultimately going to hit, it's actually making a positive contribution to us, which is good; and helping us supply our Indian customers, which is also a good thing. We want to see that going to our customers around the world. So overall, I mean, they continue to have a ramp-up plan. It's certainly been slower than we would have loved to see, but that is what it is."", ""Having said all that, though, Ma'aden continues -- in this market, particularly, Ma'aden continues to be highly advantaged with natural gas price and they're paying in the Kingdom of [indiscernible]. That represents an unbelievable sort of structural advantage to that operation. And then the other one is a very low sulfur cost. So one would expect that Ma'aden right now would have a very low actual cost per tonne compared to the rest of the world and probably is now taking its place as the low-cost producer."", ""In terms of ammonia availability, our ammonia availability, I think that was the second part of your question, has been actually unrestricted. We have basically two-thirds to 75% produced between ourselves and our contract with CF and then the rest that we're buying on the open market, which we have long-term agreements and contracts that tend to make that work quite well. And I think if I look back to it, our price for ammonia was in the high-$500 range compared to a $1,200-plus on the market.

I think, Brazil, probably more than anywhere, we've got out of sync with our turnarounds and some of our maintenance because of COVID."", ""And again, these things take time to play out. But we had to delay and minimize a number of turnarounds, and particularly the plants that were impacted the most were probably our Shaw [ph] plant, where we had a couple of failures of equipment that was -- we had the parts sitting there, but because of restrictions that the communities put on us and others, we put off the shutdown too. I think it was supposed to be the third quarter of this year. And then we've had breakdowns of that equipment."", ""And in Tapira, we had a couple of issues with respect to the conveying systems and stuff. And it's just been harder to get them fixed and longer to get them fixed, particularly in Brazil. And so, there's been a bit of a hangover there in Brazil from that.

205,Clint Freeland,"[""And Andrew, this is Clint. I think to the second part of your question about what you're seeing in the corporate segment, I think the driver of that is intercompany sales. It's profit and inventory, and that typically happens when one business unit makes sales to another business unit, but the final tonnes haven't gone to a third party yet. And we had about 300,000 tonnes move -- in June move from phosphates down to Fertilizantes. And so I think that's what you're seeing in the corporate segment."", ""We do that so that as the results of the individual segments come together for the consolidated number, we need that offset to get all the numbers right.

And secondly, in your cash flows from financing activities, if you exclude what you did in terms of debt paydown and share repurchase and dividends, you had a negative $672 million outflow. And the number isn't as negative for the year. But I was wondering, when you net out all of those numbers for 2022, what should they be? And why aren't those numbers in cash flow from operations? So, I guess those are the two questions.""]",question_answer,MOS_591416

Jeff, I'm going to let Clint give the first one as he's still trying to figure out what exactly you're -- no, he's ready. I'm going to get -- let Clint and then I'm going to come back and talk to you about the price forecast for phosphates.""]",question_answer,MOS_591416
209,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes, Jeff, I think what you're seeing are some of the entries associated with some of the short-term financings that we have – we have not only inventory financing facilities that we use seasonally to finance some of our working capital, but I think some of the other entries that you may be seeing are related to some of the account receivable securitization facilities."", ""And those are some of our working capital funding mechanisms that we use, again, through the seasons and one of the things, in particular in the second quarter is, as we look at the increase in customer prepayments, particularly down in Brazil, year-to-date, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, year-to-date, that's up about $830 million. And when we look at that, that is a source of working capital financing to us."", ""And so, as that cash comes in and that typically lands in your cash from operations line. We use that cash to actually replace other sources of working capital financing, like our inventory financing and our AR financing. And so, as we use that basically cost – the interest-free working capital financing from customer prepays to pay off some of those lines that were drawn earlier in the year, what you'll see is a disconnect because the free payments are intact from operations, pen down [ph] short-term lines are down in financing."", ""And so, what you'll see also though in the back half of the year, as those prepayments reverse out, I think you'll probably start to drawn off of some of those lines and probably see a reversal of what you're seeing through the second quarter. So happy to spend some more time with you and go through that in more detail off-line. But I think that's what you're seeing is some of the -- replacing external third-party financing with customer prepays as those dollars come in and that I would expect kind of those dynamics to reverse out in the back half of the year.""]",question_answer,MOS_591416
210,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Okay. So Jeff, let me talk a little bit about the phosphate price forecast. And we didn't mean to confuse in any way. I think the challenge is, again, same thing. It depends a little bit on when sales come in. And at this stage, I think we're only about 25% sold and priced for the quarter. So pretty early in the piece in terms of what we expect. So, I guess the way you could look at it is, prices have retreated from where we were in the second quarter slightly and moderated."", ""And I think we're now at a stable range. So, you can almost look at today's price – if you take the cost of freight from today's published price, you'd be pretty close to where we're -- what we're going to see for the quarter. So, I think that would be the easiest way to look at it. Certainly, I think pricing has come down a bit from quarter two, moderated a little bit, but we expect it to stabilize about where we are and probably stay at about where spot is right now for the quarter.""]",question_answer,MOS_591416

Adjusted EPS was $2.41. And adjusted EBITDA was $1.45 billion.', 'Our results continue to highlight the positive evolution of our business, which reflect the contribution from Brazil. The additional production from the restart of Colonsay and the transition to K3, one of the largest and most efficient potash mines in the world.', 'Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totalled $632 million, reflecting the impact of strong pricing, which more than offset higher input costs. Potash also benefited from higher prices, as well as the transition to Esterhazy K3, and the elimination of brine inflow management costs. As a result, segment adjusted EBITDA totalled $651 million.', 'In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $233 million, as the team capitalized on a strong market environment and its inventory position, particularly towards the end of the quarter, as seasonal demand began to pick up.', 'Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending well beyond 2022. The year began with a tight agricultural market and elevated prices reflecting at 20-year low in global grain and oil seed stock to use ratios.', ""The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has exacerbated the situation and pushed soft commodity prices, even higher. Together, these two countries account for 16% of global grain and oil seed export market. With Ukraine's planting season now at risk in the coming year and Russian crop export potentially also being constrained, the market is grappling with the potential of reduced supply of a number of key crops, which includes wheat and corn, but also oil seeds like soybeans, sunflowers and their respective oil."", 'This situation has amplified food security concerns and is resulting in protectionist government policies that will likely drive commodity prices even higher. As an example, last week, Indonesia placed a temporary ban on exports of palm oil, one of the most commonly used cooking oils in the world to ensure domestic supply. All of this suggests elevated crop prices are likely to persist for the remainder of 2022 and beyond.', 'The strength in crop prices, combined with global fertilizer industry supply constraints, have pushed nutrient prices higher. In potash sanctions against Belarus and uncertainty over Russian exports are having an impact on supply. Global prices have pushed higher as buyers look to secure adequate volumes.', 'The global phosphate market has also priced an uncertainty around Russian supply of both finished products and inputs like ammonia and sulfur. But we are seeing some movement of Russian phosphates today.', ""In addition, China's export restrictions remain in place. While we expect an easing of China's restrictions, we believe phosphate exports will drift lower over time as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehicle, lithium iron phosphate batteries."", 'On the demand side, we expect global shipments of potash and phosphate to be down from 2021. But the cause of this is availability, not affordability. Consumption will be forced to adjust to available supply.', ""In North America, whether is indicating the possibility of a compressed application season, but growers remain incentivized to maximize yield. Today's crop prices more than offset input cost, which suggests that farmer profitability in 2022 will be at the second highest level in more than a decade."", ""Similarly grower economics have also improved in Brazil, thanks to rising soybean prices. In India farmer demand for nutrients remains very strong, thanks to another good monsoon season and strong global grain prices, but availability is still lagging. In response to stronger grower demand and historically low domestic inventories last week, the government increased fertilizer subsidies. We see this as a positive development that should help to meet some, though likely not all of India's significant pent-up demand."", ""As we look at our business in the context of today's global markets, we remain very optimistic. In potash K3s ramp-up to the initially targeted 5.5 million tonnes per year is now complete. Logistical constraints and winter weather impacted first quarter shipments and production, but these issues appear to be largely behind us. In addition Colonsay, which was down in March as rail constraints forced temporary curtailment is now back online and operating at an expanded run rate of 1.3 million tonnes over our initial target of 1 million tonnes. In the second quarter, we expect sales volumes of 2.4 million to 2.6 million tonnes. Realized prices in the second quarter are expected to be $40 to $60 per tonne higher than realized prices in the first quarter."", 'In phosphates, we expect a recovery in volumes in 2022. Raw material costs have escalated, but we are well supplied to meet our production targets. In ammonia, we continue to benefit from a significant cost advantage thanks to our internal production at Faustina, and our supply agreement with CF Industries. In the first quarter 80% of our ammonia needs were met by tonnes linked directly to Henry Hub [indiscernible] and shielded from the price swings in the global ammonia market. As a result, our first quarter ammonia costs were roughly half of the benchmark prices. In the second quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes of 1.9 million to 2.1 million tonnes.', 'Our expected sale volumes reflect an improvement in logistics plays somewhat offset by inventories well below historic levels. Second quarter phosphate prices on an fob basis are expected to be $140 to $160 per tonne higher than first quarter prices. Price increases in the quarter are expected to significantly outpace the impact of higher raw material prices on our cost structure. For Mosaic Fertilizantes we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformational efforts over the last two years.', 'Seasonal demand began picking up late in the first quarter and should continue through the software season. We expect to benefit as potash inventories, which were built during the fourth quarter begin shipping to customers. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure, but believe ongoing optimization should offset much of the impact. Given the direction of our business we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022, returning capital to shareholders remains a key part of our strategy. We continue to expect returning up to 75% of our free cash to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends, including the $463 million returned in the first quarter of 2022. We completed the $400 million accelerated share repurchase program announced last quarter and continued to repurchase shares through our existing authorization. As a reminder, last quarter our Board also approved a new $1 billion authorization.', 'In the area of balance sheet strength we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Part of that target was met with the retirement of $450 million last year, and we expect to reach the finish line later this year when another $550 million of long-term debt reaches maturity.', ""Given our look for the year, we expect will also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business. We seek out high return, modest investments in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials, and investments in soil health and biologics. With recent disruptions to fertilizer supply, a situation we believe could extend for some time. We are also actively exploring de-bottlenecking opportunities to increase our fertilizer production as quickly as possible. In potash, we've already raised Colonsay's annual run rate to 1.3 million tonnes, up from our initial restart target of 1 million tonnes, and we see a path to reach 1.8 to 2 million tonnes in the second half of 2023 through the restart of Colonsay's second mill."", ""At Esterhazy, we are exploring the de-bottlenecking of the mills, which could add several hundred thousand tonnes by the second half of next year. In total, these initiatives could add roughly 1.5 million tonnes of potash production by the end of 2023. The cost for all these projects is expected to be less than $100 million. In North American phosphates we expect production to be roughly 1 million tonnes higher than the 2021 production total of 7.3 million tonnes. As headwinds experience last year addressed, and our assets run at more normal rates. In Brazil we are pushing for improved recovery from our phosphate mines, and we're exploring the expansion of our Taquari mine that increases production and extends its life."", 'In total when one considers our footprint in North America, our production in Brazil and our allocation of [indiscernible] finished product. By the end of 2023, we have the potential to see operating rates close to 25 million tonnes of total finished product well above our 2021 production total of 19.7 million tonnes. We take our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs very seriously. We believe that geopolitical issues that have impacted global supply during the first quarter will not be reversed any time soon. As a result, we are pulling every lever we have to efficiently raise our production rates to help offset the supply shortages from other sources in ways that also creates value for shareholders.', ""With that let's move on to the Q&A portion of the call.""]",management_discussion,MOS_311095

In North America, buyer behavior is focused on near-term applications. Weather has forced a compressed planting season but today's crop prices suggest growers will continue seeking maximum yields. In Brazil, grower appetite for fertilizers is quite strong especially with recent crop price moves and a slightly weakening Brazilian real.

I think it tends to be a little bit on the high end of that right now, given the pricing environment that we're in. But then as we use those raw materials, it'll go into inventory, but it'll go into inventory finished product at cost, and so it'll migrate obviously into that account."", ""When we sell it though, and that's again at cost and so it's still a relatively small number, that'll really be driven by volume of finished product.

And that's where you will tend to see the receivables grow pretty materially, because embedded in there is also our margin on top of the cost.

Adjusted earnings per share, was $5.04, the highest since 2011. Our results were a reflection of strong performance across all of our segments. Phosphate segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion, over 200% higher than the segment’s total in 2020, reflecting strong pricing and growth in MicroEssentials, which more than offset the production impacts of Hurricane Ida. Potash segment adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion, up 78% from the prior year as pricing, increased output from K3 and the reset at Colonsay largely mitigated the closure at K1 and K2. In Brazil, Mosaic Fertilizantes generated adjusted EBITDA of $821 million, up 74% from the prior year as the team capitalized on strong demand, a trend that we expected and drove our decision to acquire Fertilizantes 4 years ago. In 2021, Mosaic Fertilizantes was able to achieve its $200 million transformational EBITDA improvement target over a year ahead of schedule. These results highlight the decisions we have made over the last decade that has strengthened the business. Most significant has been the construction of K3, which at full capacity will be one of the largest, most efficient and automated potash mines in the world. Assuming a net investment consistent with what we discussed at our 2019 Analyst Day, at today’s prices, K3’s payback period can be measured in months rather than years. Also in potash, we successfully restarted Colonsay and reached our targeted annual run-rate of 1 million tons during the fourth quarter. Colonsay’s fourth quarter cash cost averaged $85 per ton, well below our pre-idled cost of $100 a ton despite higher price-driven taxes and royalties. In Brazil, our acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes in 2018 followed by the team’s transformational work to improve margins, has driven significant shareholder value. At the time of the transaction, pro forma EBITDA was less than $70 million. Our 2021 results show that we have been able to optimize that business through integration and transformational share gains and co-product sales. In our phosphate business, performance products, primarily higher margin MicroEssentials, now account for more than 40% of the segment’s finished product sales volumes. All of these decisions, combined with strong execution, put us in a position to benefit from 2021’s favorable market backdrop and improve Mosaic’s financial position. In 2021, Mosaic retired $450 million of long-term debt, raised the annual dividend by 50%, and repurchased nearly $0.5 billion in shares. Looking forward, we continue to see agricultural market strength extending through 2022. Global demand for grain and oilseeds remains high, while stock-to-use ratios are at the lowest point in more than a decade. Food security concerns and rising bio-fuel consumption are driving demand for corn and soybean as well as rice, wheat, coffee, palm oil and other agricultural commodities. These dynamics are sustaining agricultural commodity prices. It’s the strength in crop markets, combined with global industry supply constraints that have pushed fertilizer prices higher. Global supply disruptions from 2021 are expected to continue impacting the global market in 2022. In potash, sanctions against Belarus are beginning to have a profound impact on supply. Global buyers are beginning to acknowledge this, including India and China, which both signed contracts with Canpotex at $590 per ton to ensure they have adequate supply for 2022. In phosphates, the secular shift of Chinese supply away from exports towards domestic agriculture and industrial consumption is expected to outlast the short-term export ban currently in place. Over time, we believe domestic demand will drive China’s phosphate exports lower as secular demand trends continue to grow, especially on the industrial side from chemicals and electric vehicles, lithium-ion phosphate batteries. Globally, strong demand over the last 18 months resulted in many producers delaying maintenance downtime to meet customer needs, which will have to be addressed at some point. On the demand side, farmer economics in most global growing regions remains constructive. Inflation and input costs are impacting profitability, but recent increases in crop prices are improving farmer economics for 2022, even if that estimated profitability remains below the 2021 record levels. As we head into North American spring planting season, we are seeing normal buyer behavior as demand continues to reflect strong underlying crop prices. In Brazil, fertilizer shipments in 2022, appears set to equal last year’s record-setting total. Grower economics are improving, thanks to rising crop prices, credit availability and a favorable exchange rate. In India, while farmer demand remains very strong, availability is still lagging. This month, the Indian government released its initial budget for nutrient subsidies, highlighting the Indian government’s willingness to respond to market condition with revisions. Given depleted Indian inventories, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should see phosphate and potash consumption growth in 2022. As we look at our business in the context of today’s global markets, we remain very optimistic. In potash, K3’s ramp up is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter, meaning it will reach full capacity under budget and 2 years ahead of schedule. When combined with Belle Plaine and a full year of production from Colonsay, we expect higher production in 2022 with production costs trending lower as the year progresses. In the first quarter, we expect sales volume of 1.8 million to 2 million tons, with average realized FOB prices more than $125 per ton higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter. In phosphates, we also expect a recovery in volume in 2022 following last year’s production curtailments related to sulfur shortage in the second quarter and Hurricane Ida in the third and fourth quarters. We expect to see input cost inflation in 2022, especially related to our open market purchases of sulfur and ammonia. But in ammonia, we continue to benefit from two-thirds of our needs being met by internal production and our supply agreement with CF Industries. In the first quarter, we expect phosphate sales volumes of 1.6 million to 1.8 million tons. Our expected sales volumes reflect supply chain constraints as well as low inventories at the start of the year because of Hurricane Ida. Average realized FOB prices are expected to be more than $60 per ton higher than prices realized in the fourth quarter somewhat offset by higher input costs. For Mosaic Fertilizantes, we expect the business to continue reflecting the favorable market backdrop and our transformation efforts in 2022. Sustained grower demand and improved market positioning should continue to drive results. We are seeing inflation affect our cost structure, but believe our transformation initiatives should offset much of the impact. Given the direction of our business, we anticipate generating significant earnings and free cash flow in 2022. With that in mind, it is imperative that we allocate capital wisely across our three strategic focus areas of capital return to shareholders, balance sheet strength and investing in the business. Returning capital to shareholders will be a key focus in 2022. Over the coming year, we anticipate returning most of our free cash flow, up to 75% to shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends. At today’s price, we believe our shares represent compelling value given the dynamics we are seeing. To underscore this point, we will be initiating a $400 million accelerated share repurchase program in the coming days. After the ASR, we will have repurchased approximately $830 million against our $1 billion authorization established last August. We plan to exhaust the remaining portion of that authorization through open-market purchases. As a result, Mosaic’s Board has approved a new $1 billion repurchase authorization, which goes into effect after the current program is completed. The ASR and our new authorization together represent about 8% of our market capitalization. Combining both authorizations represents approximately 12% of our current market cap. In addition to share repurchases, Mosaic’s Board has also approved raising the regular annual dividend from $0.45 to $0.60 per share beginning in the second quarter. This is the third regular dividend hike in the last 12 months and reflects our confidence in the long-term strength of the business. In the area of balance sheet strength, we remain committed to reducing long-term debt by $1 billion. Last year, we retired $450 million, which will use $550 million left towards our ultimate goal. This coincides with $550 million of long-term debt that matures later this year. It is also important to note that our working capital needs tend to grow as our end markets strengthen. Because of this, we have expanded our working capital lending facilities by $375 million to help us more efficiently manage our liquidity. Given our outlook for the year, we expect we’ll also be able to continue investing wisely and efficiently in our business, even as we return the majority of our capital to shareholders. Over the last 5 years, the value created by key investments, like accelerated construction of K3, the acquisition of Mosaic Fertilizantes and the development and growth of MicroEssentials, speaks for itself. Looking forward, we will continue to seek out high returning investments, but our focus is not on large scale greenfield projects. Rather, we believe better return can be realized in areas like enlarging our footprint in Brazil, expansion of MicroEssentials and investment in soil health and biologics. In the last area, we are seeing very promising results. As an example, through our partnership with BioConsortia, field trials of the first-generation nitrogen fixing formulation for corn has shown promising results that we believe are as good as anything available in the market today. And we believe further development can result in a best-in-class nitrogen solution for growers in the next 2 years. We will have exclusive rights to that product when it comes to market in the Americas, China and India, key growing regions that want to reduce their nitrogen cost. This is just one example of many partnerships as we continue to explore grower solutions across biologicals and soil health and we continue to do this through small, efficient investments that establish exclusive rights partnerships like with BioConsortia or give us access to entire product portfolios as is the case with our recent investment in Plant Response, a small ag technology company that develops and commercializes plant and soil health products. In total, we have invested approximately $50 million over the last 2 years to build the foundation for an exciting future portfolio of value-add products that our customers are asking for. We anticipate having more to share on these investments over time. These moves emphasize our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. We will remain flexible in our approach, continuing to evaluate compelling opportunities that strengthen our business over the long-term, optimize our balance sheet and return significant capital to shareholders. Finally, a discussion of the future of our business would be incomplete without including an update on some of the initiatives we have taken to make sure we continue to operate sustainably. Over the last year, we have made significant progress towards our ESG performance targets originally set in 2020, so much so that we have set even higher targets. In the area of carbon emissions, Mosaic has set a target of being net zero at its Florida operations by 2030 and globally by 2040. For diversity and inclusion, we set new goals for 2030 around the issues of race, gender and community support. Our global goals ensure that our actions are purposeful, sustainable and measurable as we seek to operate our business, while also helping to build a more inclusive culture where all of our employees can thrive. With that, let’s move on to the Q&A portion of the call.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
280,Paul Massoud,"['Thanks, Joc. Before we open the lines to the live Q&A, we are going to address some of the most common questions we received last night after our materials were released. To speed things along, we won’t identify each individual analyst, because many submitted similar questions. Our first question is on the issue of the potash market in Belarus. How should investors think about the impact of sanctions on the global market?']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
281,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you. First, the potash market was already tight before any sanctions came into place. Higher crop prices, higher demand for fertilizer globally has led to a tightness in this market that was driving higher prices before the Belarusian sanctions. The Belarusian sanctions have simply exacerbated and made the tightness more serious. In terms of the length of the sanctions, we really don’t know and there is no obvious immediate resolution to that issue right now sort of maybe a regime change, I can’t see how that issue is going to be resolved. In terms of the shortfall, we believe it could be anywhere from a few million tons in the best case scenario to as much as 8 million tons if the sanctions remain all through the year. Our base case we are working on right now is that there will be about a 4 million ton deficit this year. Now, the best evidence for this from our perspective is not what we see, but what our buyers are saying. Our buyers are signaling that this issue could be longer lasting than some of our producers have suggested. India and China both signed 2022 contracts of $590 for longer durations than the previous 6-month contracts. And we are hearing similar sentiment from our other global customers. They cannot get the tonnage. And if they can, there is no method to pay for with U.S. banks. So, it’s fair to assume that every producer is likely already evaluating every economic ton that they can get out to the market, including us. But remember, in addition to maximizing and increasing tonnage, we cannot forget about the supply chain constraints. To substantially increase our logistics capability, producers will need more railcars or port capacity and all of this takes time and capital to overcome.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
282,Paul Massoud,"['A follow-up question on this issue: how much can Mosaic raise volumes to help fill the gap? Specifically, what run-rates are you targeting and is there any potential upside in the near term?']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
283,Joc O’Rourke,"['Yes. Thank you. Before the sanctions, Mosaic’s targeted run-rate by the end of the first quarter was about 10.5 million tons. And let me just quickly give you the breakup of that. Esterhazy in its existing form, we believe can run a consistent, sustainable 5.5 million tons; Belle Plaine, around 3 million tons; Colonsay before the shutdown was running somewhere around 1 million to 1.5 million tons, and we will find the right spot for that this year. That gives us an MLP tonnage of around 9.5 million to 10 million tons available today and then K-Mag at just a little over 700,000 tons takes our total to about 10.5 million tons of sustainable production capability. So as we look forward, what can we do to push our capabilities? We know we have some latent capacity at Colonsay and we are looking right now on how we can do a little extra development to put some mining panels into place that were shutdown a few years ago. In terms of K3, the run-rate of 5.5 million tons, we think we could run a little more than that and that will play out as we start getting more and more mining areas running and we get the 11th miner in position. The other issue at Esterhazy, we think, we think there is some pretty good debottlenecking projects that we are already studying and we believe some of those will lead to a little better tonnage coming out of Esterhazy. In terms of Belle Plaine, we believe it’s running pretty much at its maximum right now. So the easy tonnages will come from debottlenecking, Colonsay getting more miners into higher production panels and then pushing K3 and doing the small debottlenecking projects that come at the end of a long capital project.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
284,Paul Massoud,"['Joc, the next issue is on the broader phosphate market in China, in particular. How much will China export this year? And could that export ban be lifted early?']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
285,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you. We think China exports could be down as much as 2.5 million tons this year to about 9 million tons. We do expect that the ban could be lifted as early as the ending of the planting season. And we have to expect that at today’s prices, it wouldn’t be surprising to see China’s producers try to benefit from that high-price environment. But we do think that annual exports are going to continue to trend lower over time. Secular domestic demand in China will pull increasingly large amounts of phosphates away from the export market. And we cannot ignore industrial uses. Battery growth and domestic fertilizers will take precedence over exports, and we expect the Chinese government will continue to force suppliers to prioritize domestic demand.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
286,Paul Massoud,"['Our next question focuses on farmer economics. And I think this one’s for you, Jenny. Our grower economics now at the point where nutrient demand destruction is a real threat to the market.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
287,Jenny Wang,"['At today’s crop prices around all major growing regions, we are seeing farmers’ economics and affordability are very constructive. In the – it is probably lower than last year’s level, but it is far above the historical average. In North America, we are seeing customers and farmers behavior are as normal as the pre-spring season. In Brazil, especially over the last few weeks as sodium price rise, we are seeing very strong customer buying happening in the country. And in India, we expect the government is going to do, again, readjust their subsidy level in order to support their farmers’ demand to phosphate and potash as they did last year. If there is any threat to the consumption of demand, it is probably because of lack of availability across both phosphate and potash. And the global demand is there if the tons are available.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
288,Paul Massoud,"['Joc, we’ve received quite a few questions on phosphate first quarter guidance. 1.6 million to 1.8 million tons seems like compared to history. What’s happening there? Is the lower sales volume guidance due to operational issues or due to demand destruction and buyers blocking at current prices?']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
289,Joc O’Rourke,"['Well, thank you. In terms of our expected volumes for quarter one, I think there is really two big issues we have to consider when we look at our sales volume. The first of all is actually quarter four, where Hurricane Ida and subsequent repair events impacted at the beginning of the fourth quarter and left us with very, very low inventories entering this year, which, of course, tends to contribute to first quarter sales. In terms of the other issue from our perspective, it’s really the logistics. COVID and winter weather are having a major impact on the supply chain, including rail, ocean freight, ports and trucking logistics. The industry is seeing delays throughout the system, and that’s contributing to the lower-than-historical sales volume guidance. Just as an example, rail alone this year, we’re seeing about a 20% to 30% increase in cycle time for our trains. And you can expect that to have a big impact on rev rec at the very end of the quarter. That said, we expect our annual sales to be in line with historic norms for phosphates. Delayed shipments due to supply chain issues will resolve themselves as we come out of the winter weather and we get through this last wave of COVID. So we will see those come in the next quarter or two. The thing I would emphasize is we’re seeing normal buyer behavior. Yes, nutrient prices are up. The crop prices more than offset that and point to a very good year for grower profitability, even if it’s a small step back from the 2021 levels. We expect crop prices to continue to incentivize farmers to apply fertilizer as they normally would.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
290,Paul Massoud,"['Clint, our last two questions are for you. The first set is on working capital. Can you add some color around working capital and what you anticipate needs to be in 2022?']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
291,Clint Freeland,"['Sure. Thanks, Paul. So I think, as everyone knows, our business is highly seasonal, and we can experience pretty significant working capital changes throughout the year. And over the last couple of years, we have put in new working capital facilities to help us manage through – excuse me, some of that seasonal dynamic. And in the current pricing environment and the environment that we’ve been in and the rate of change that we’ve seen, that just amplifies those seasonal working capital moves. And so more recently, we’ve upsized some of our working capital lines to better align our options and our tools to the needs of the business. Just to give you a sense, as we look at the second half of last year, our core working capital needs were up well over $1 billion, and majority of that was in the fourth quarter. And as we look forward to 2022, I think any incremental working capital needs are likely to be dictated by the pricing environment that we see to the extent that the pricing environment moderates and the rate of change moderates, then I think the working capital incremental needs will moderate. But if we do see a continuation of what we’ve seen in the last 6 months, I think we could expect to see increasing working capital requirements.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
292,Paul Massoud,"['Clint, our final question is on our capital allocation strategy. We seem to be prioritizing share repurchases over other uses of capital. Is that correct? And what are those other uses? And is it possible to do it all and given our commitment to return up to 75% of our free cash flow to shareholders?']",management_discussion,MOS_271218
293,Clint Freeland,"['Thanks, Paul. As we look forward to the balance of 2022, we expect to generate a significant amount of earnings and cash flow. And as we think about capital allocation for this year, we intend to continue strengthening both our business and our balance sheet by continuing to invest in high-return and opportunistic investments and paying down debt. But we think we can do those things and return a significant amount of capital to shareholders this year within the construct that we’ve outlined. Today, we announced an increase in our dividend for this year and going forward as well as a buyback using an ASR tool. As we go through the balance of the year, we intend to remain disciplined and nimble and look at different ways of returning capital to our shareholders. But our current priority is on buybacks. We look at our share price, where it is, and we think that it is compelling given the environment that we see. So that’s our priority today. But again, we intend to remain flexible as we go through the year.']",management_discussion,MOS_271218

296,John Roberts,"['Thank you. I assume in Brazil that the competitor distributors are significantly exposed to Russian and Ukrainian potash. If they have to – if they have trouble sourcing potash, if your competition is trouble sourcing potash, does that also impact their ability to cross-sell other inputs, that is if farmers have to turn to Fertilizantes for potash, are you likely to pick up the other inputs as well?']",question_answer,MOS_271218
297,Joc O’Rourke,"['Yes. Thanks, John. Certainly, that would offer an opportunity to us, but I suspect what will happen is that actually the blends will probably be adjusted for less potash if there is actual potash shortages. And we do believe there will be a real risk of potash shortages. The Brazil market should be fairly good. They have been delayed by rain and etcetera, so far. But we believe this will be a good market. So we do expect it’s going to be very tight for potash as the full impact of the sanctions really comes home to roost, if you will. So yes, we may pick up a little bit, but I don’t think it will be because of the blend opportunity versus others. I think it will just be because of people trying to get hold of potash.']",question_answer,MOS_271218

We have been flexible in the past, as you’re well aware, including last year when we had an inability to produce. We asked and allowed Nutrien to produce the gap, which they helped fill.

And now it appears Colonsay has had a nice gap down in cash costs post the issues you were facing in last year. So when we all kind of take a look at this year under the context of current contract spot pricing, higher operating rates, transportation costs and even the Canadian resource tax, can we just take a step back and just look at where you ultimately think the gross margins should be for this year?

I think you can pretty much make estimates. We’ve announced Colonsay being $85 a ton. The others are significantly lower than that. And put a round number on transport, which is easy to do.

309,Clint Freeland,['But I would say that both of those are in our EBITDA calculation.'],question_answer,MOS_271218
310,Joc O’Rourke,"['Yes. And do recognize the resource tax is quite significant right now. So in terms of Florida cost, if you will, for phosphates, the way you can look at it is, first of all, our average ammonia cost, which if – we pay 20% of – sorry, 20% of the cost per ton of ammonia goes into – so if ammonia costs $600, you can – times that by 0.2, and that’s the cost inside that. But right now, market ammonia is probably in the range of, Jenny, $1,100. So that adds about $200 plus per ton to the cost of making phosphates. Now recognize our costs are significantly lower than that because two-thirds of ours is on a natural gas basis. So for our competitors, call it, $250 per ton. For us, probably more than half of that range would be the right number. In terms of sulfur, sulfur 40%. So if sulfur price is $300, then your cost in making DAP is probably $120-ish per ton. So you could look at that for our competitors being a total cost of up to $300 extra ton and for us, probably $220 or something, in that range.']",question_answer,MOS_271218

312,Steve Byrne,"['Yes. Joc, I want to ask you maybe a two-part question on Ferlizantes. And the first one being these co-product sales. Is that the gypsum or – I know you have some titanium and overburden there. What’s driving that, the co-product sales? And then maybe a higher-level question on Fertilizantes is, where do you think you can take that business from here? Is the opportunity in expanding your domestic production there? Or being able to increase more imports with port expansions? Where do you see the most opportunity in Fertilizantes?']",question_answer,MOS_271218
313,Joc O’Rourke,"['Okay. So first, co-product sales, I think you’re absolutely right. The majority of the co-product sales is likely the sale of gypsum, but there is a number of co-products whether they be produced from some of our wastewater streams or whatever. But we sold last year, I think, over $400 million of co-products with pretty healthy margin because the cost of these, of course, is very low. So we feel that’s a pretty attractive place. And of course, when you sell gypsum, that’s chips actually you don’t have to make in the future. So again, a big piece of the long-term business improvement will be those sales of co-products and particularly the sale of gypsum. In terms of moving this business forward, you’re right, there is a number of opportunities. I think there is a number of new opportunities for co-products and particularly when you look at titanium, niobium and whatnot that is naturally in our ore and is made by our neighbors, at least our neighbors at Catalao. The other area is distribution. And distribution, particularly as you go to the Northwest part of the country, so Northwest part of Montegrosso and heading into what we call the Montapito states, which are the northern states south of the Amazon but in the western side of the country. We believe the distribution opportunity there is high. We are looking very seriously about how we can get a bigger piece of that, how we can participate more in that. So distribution, one area; co-products, new products. And of course, if we can debottleneck or improve our existing operations, that’s another great area for taking advantage of what is a great market.']",question_answer,MOS_271218

316,Joc O’Rourke,"['Yes. Okay. Thanks, Vincent. I’m going to start off, but I’m going to hand it over to Jenny. But I think what you’d be fair to say is when the demand started really picking up this year, India was the first to respond. And in the typical winter lull, North American prices probably lagged, but those are quickly catching up as we get closer to the North American spring. But let me let Jenny talk a little bit about price disparity around the world and what that means.']",question_answer,MOS_271218
317,Jenny Wang,"['Sure, Joc. Yes, you mentioned due to the very low input in India last year, we saw the pent-up demand. And for sure, that was realized in the first two months of the year. And the Indians basically paid DAP price up to $920. Vincent I think probably you referred to the gap between India and the rest of the world. And with the crop prices rallied in Brazil, over the last few weeks, we saw the Brazilian buyers also stepped into the market. After yesterday, the gap between Brazil in phosphate to India are very close. So, we saw the price of MAP in Brazil already reached over to $900 per ton. And similarly to NOLA, we saw some seasonal price lows. And over the last two weeks, that price has rebounded, and we saw the shrinking of price gap between NOLA in India as well. Overall, we see a pretty much strong demand supported by the farmer economics and also pent-up demand in India and in the case of China as well. We see the fundamental of the phosphate market is going to continue to be tight, and the price level is going to stay at an elevated level.']",question_answer,MOS_271218

Just wanted to get a sense in terms of your longer term expectations for India’s ability to continue to afford fertilizer, I know that they have raised their subsidies, but it seems like prices are going up at a pretty fast rate. How do you sort of see India’s demand evolving over the next several years, not just in 2022 where they need to restock? Thanks.']",question_answer,MOS_271218
321,Joc O’Rourke,"['Yes. Thanks, Michael. Look, I think India – this becomes more than a simple problem for a country like India with 700 people living in basic poverty and relying on the agricultural economy. The Modi government needs to be responsive to those people. So, they have a tight balance to keep food security and food affordability for their population and also keep their farmers able to be profitable so that they keep farming. So, our expectation is that India will continue to tread that – or walk that tight rope as best they can. So, they will have to respond to global pricing. They will have to make sure they get the fertilizer they need. And we are seeing that right now. I mean with the fast settlement of their potash and the – at $590, they were the first to settle with Canpotex quite early, and I think that reflects the pent-up demand that they need to make sure it gets out to their farmers. And then we just talked about their willingness to pay $930 or $920 for phosphates. So, we are seeing the buyer response. We know the government will have to either help with food subsidies or with fertilizer subsidies to keep that balance. And I know when it comes down to food securities, they are going to do what they have to do to make sure that works. And that’s long-term and short-term.']",question_answer,MOS_271218

323,Andrew Wong,"['Okay. Good morning. Just a couple of questions here. First one, Fertilizantes. Can you just talk about why the phosphate rock and conversion costs continue to move up through the year? Is that mostly due to local inflation? And what’s the expected run rate of the current FX rates for this year and going forward? And then maybe a second question, probably more for Clint. Mosaic is a very complicated business. It’s across multiple geographies and product lines. And I mean it can be difficult sometimes to model out some of the variabilities around the quarters and even maybe for the year. Is there any thought on providing some more specific guidance, such as maybe including Fertilizantes in the kind of quarterly outlook guidance or maybe even cutting to like a specific EBITDA line? Thanks.']",question_answer,MOS_271218
324,Joc O’Rourke,"['Okay. Thanks, Andrew. And I will leave the tougher guidance question to Clint because that’s only fair. Let me start with Fertilizantes and the cost structure of Fertilizantes. There is a lot of factors, I think that are impacting Fertilizantes right now. I mean the first of it, as you mentioned, is inflation. And if you look at U.S. dollars, it’s probably easier to see where that’s been not as severe as what it might look like. But Brazil is probably seeing in industrial inflation, somewhere in that 15% to 20% this year. And that’s having a real day-to-day impact on cost structures. The other thing that has hurt Brazil in the last while, of course, is COVID. It has made it a lot more difficult to do mechanical or maintenance turnarounds. It’s made getting supply chain people in place, etcetera, etcetera. So, there is maintenance that takes longer, just a lot of little niggle things that come with the people problems and the COVID problems. And then there is of course, supply chain issues, getting materials and when you get materials are more expensive. So, all of those things are impacting. We think that long-term U.S. dollar and U.S. dollar to Brazilian reais will be offset with the inflation rates. So, in other words, if the inflation keeps higher than U.S., it will probably be equalized by exchange rates. And the other issues should go away with COVID and whatnot as things sort of return to more normal.']",question_answer,MOS_271218

I am going to let Jenny talk a little bit about this, but let me start off by saying as we look at this over the next, let’s say, 3 years to 5 years and even short-term, short-term, we expect China’s exports to be lower, which should lead to a tightness in the next little while. And as we look forward from that, assuming the market continues to grow at the normal rates, we don’t have any big projects coming forward that we think are going to fill that gap. So, we see it tight this year. And assuming our Chinese estimates are correct, continuing tight for the next 4 years or 5 years even. And then as we look at the evolution of industrial uses for phosphates, and we talked about lithium iron phosphate, batteries in particular. But as we move into those other uses for phosphates, particularly in China, we do expect long-term that the Chinese exports will continue to decline and that new projects that are – haven’t been called yet and take 4 years or 5 years will have to fill that gap. Jenny, anything else? Okay. So Jenny is fine. Okay. Look, with that, I will conclude our call here by reiterating some of our key messages. Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in 2021 driven by very strong agricultural and fertilizer markets. And by leveraging the value we have created through major investments and cost restructuring. We look forward to returning much of that value that we created to our shareholders through the accelerated share repurchase, our new repurchase authorization and an increased dividend target. And with continued high levels of global fertilizer demand and ongoing tight supplies in both potash and phosphates, we expect another year of very strong value creation in 2022.

I will provide some additional context before we respond to the questions we received last night, and then we'll conclude with a live Q&A session."", ""Mosaic delivered excellent financial performance in the third quarter, with EBITDA reaching its highest level in more than a decade. Our business continues to benefit from the strong markets we've been discussing since the second half of 2020. With our North America Production recovering, and a strong order book, we'd expect the momentum to continue through the end of the year, and into 2022."", ""Before we get into our strong outlook, I want to briefly give you an update on the production issues we faced during the third quarter. As you'll remember, in June, our Esterhazy K1 and K2 potash mines experienced accelerated [Indiscernible] inflow. And we made the decision to stop operations approximately six months ahead of schedule. To help mitigate loss production, we further expedited the ramp up of K3 and restarted Colonsay. The second shaft at K3 is now operational, which paves the way for us to reach full production in the first quarter of 2022. And at Colonsay, we hit our targeted run rate in October."", 'In phosphates, the damage from Hurricane Ida, and the equipment failure at New Wales, resulted in a 300,000-ton production loss in the third quarter. Thanks to the efforts of our team, the fourth quarter production shortfall has been reduced to 100,000 tons, and operating rates should be normal by the end of the year. In both phosphates and potash, our team has worked diligently to ensure any shortfalls resulting from issues outside of our control were temporary. As we head into the end of the year and into 2022, We are well-positioned to take advantage of the current market.', 'Shifting now to agricultural markets, we continue to see strength extending well into 2022. Grain stocks remain limited and global corn and soybean demand is elevated, driven in part by surging Chinese demand and rising global biofuel demand. As a result, agricultural commodity prices remain high and farmer income remains well above historic norms. That strengthened crop markets combined with global industry supply constraints are the key drivers pushing fertilizer prices higher. In the Americas, demand is considerably stronger than we expected at the beginning of the year.', 'Brazil is expected to once again set a record for fertilizer shipments in 2021. Grower economics remain profitable, despite the latest surges in nutrient prices. And this has been reflected in the significant order book into the end of the year and into the first half of 2022. In North America, demand continues to be strong and prices have followed, reflecting a healthy domestic market benefiting from imports from a diverse group of suppliers. Grower economics remain favorable in North America, although not quite as favorable as during the first half of the year.', 'However, persistently low inventories and capacity constraints are underpinning the tight supply demand balance, as well as pricing. In India, while farmer demand remains strong, and the government has recently acted to improve importer economics for phosphates, availability is still lagging. Recent moves by the governments will likely help in the recovery of Indian imports, which lagged most of 2021 because of the disconnect between domestic subsidies and global prices. Given how depleted Indian inventories are, we see India as a source of pent-up demand, which should return to the market in 2022.', ""In Southeast Asia, fertilizer demand is benefiting from the strength in palm oil prices, and China is incenting its farmers to maximize yields through subsidized crop prices. New supply of phosphates is limited. Chinese exports are expected to decline significantly in the fourth quarter and in the first half of 2022, reflecting the directive from China's National Development and Reform Commission that major producers halt all phosphate exports to ensure adequate domestic supply."", 'In potash, demand growth continues to exceed new supply from higher operating rates announced by producers, and prices continue to rise. Putting this all together, we expect further upside in realized pricing for phosphates and potash. Our fourth-quarter order book is now about 90% committed and priced. As a result, we expect to see a sequential increase of $55 to $65 a ton in realized phosphate prices, and $110 to $130 a ton in realized potash prices. We are seeing buyer appetite for first quarter commitments as well. All of this implies higher earnings in the fourth quarter, and a very strong result continuing into 2022.', ""Our earnings are leading to substantial free cash flow generation, which has allowed us to make significant progress towards several commitments we've made. Earlier this year, we raised our regular dividend target by 50% to $0.30 a share. In October, our board approved an additional regular dividend target increase of 50% to $0.45 per share effective in 2022. In August, we repaid $450 million in long-term debt toward our target of $1 billion of debt reduction. Also in August, we announced an expanded share repurchase program of $1 billion."", 'Since that announcement, we have repurchased more than 950,000 shares. In addition to strengthening the Balance Sheet and returning capital to shareholders, we continue to evaluate further investments in the business. Capital expenditures are expected to total $1.3 billion in 2021, of which roughly $450 million is growth-related. We continue to evaluate every opportunity that allows us to further strengthen the balance sheet, grow the business, and return capital to our investors.', ""Now, before I conclude my opening remarks, I want to take a moment to recognize the many contributions of Laura Gagnon, and what she has made at Mosaic.

342,Joc O'rourke,"['Thank you. Let me start by saying the areas where consumption has been lower has been more about availability than it has been about demand destruction.

However, now the Chinese government has stepped in and restricted exports and we expect the exports to go very low in the last quarter and into Q1 of next year, which will allow for a better supply in the domestic market.', ""In terms of India, the inability to secure [Indiscernible] has not been about farmer demand, but importer economics. The inability or inadequate subsidies have really been what's driven the inability of the importers to economically bring product into that jurisdiction. However, what we do expect to see based on those two is [Indiscernible] -up demand in both China and India for early next year and into the spring season.

345,Joc O'rourke,"[""Yes. Thank you. Let me start with soil levels. We don't have perfect insight into the soil inventory per say. But what we do have is we have some studies by the likes of the University of Illinois that show that over the last 10 years actual soil inventories have decreased. And that's particularly as we view this more precision agriculture which allows you to put the right amount of fertilizer down, but it may also mean you have to replace it every year."", ""And of course, in Brazil with the depleted soil, that has to be replaced every year. So, there is definitely on-ground demand that will be there next year. In terms of channel inventory, we see that as being low in almost every jurisdiction. There is no place around the globe where we see any kind of build-up of channel inventory. And that's fundamentally different than it was years ago, where you had large amounts of inventory, not only of the fertilizers, but large inventories of crops like grains and oil seeds. So, this turnaround is quite different."", 'And so, as we look forward, we see affordability fine right now and we expect that affordability will be good, because either price will have to go up for grains and oil seed, which will drive long-term fertilizer or they will plant less, which means that prices for grains and oil seed will go up. So, in other words, the secure for high prices is high prices.']",management_discussion,MOS_225446
346,Paul Massoud,"['Joc, how are India subsidies impacting affordability?']",management_discussion,MOS_225446
347,Joc O'rourke,"[""Well, at a farmer level, it's a controlled market. So, it's very difficult to compare affordability at the farm level. Certainly, we know that on-farm demand for both phosphate and potash is very strong. At an importer level, the GAAP between global pricing and the retail price has been such that the importer economics are poor. Which means they're not importing, which means that the product isn't available to the farmer. And really that goes for both potash and phosphate. Let me add, as we move into 2022, there is a lot of pent-up demand in India. And we fully expect that the government will have to act and increase subsidies to allow the farmers to get the product they're going to need.""]",management_discussion,MOS_225446

349,Joc O'rourke,"[""Well, thank you. This year we're expecting China's total exports to run just over 10 million tons. But as we've seen recently, that has led to fairly large deficit domestically. Though the government has stepped in, pulled on export restrictions, which are now taking effect. We don't expect a whole lot of Q4 exports or probably first quarter 2022. After that, we do expect things to return to normal. So, for this year, we're expecting a little over 10 million tonnes of exports. Next year, we think that we'll return back to the say, 9.5 or 9.3 that we've had in previous years."", 'Per year-over-year, we should be down about a million and a half tonnes from where we were this year. Now, we also see a long-term decline in production of phosphate fertilizers for agricultural use. That means that the phosphoric acid is starting to find its way into a lot of other industrial products, including these lithium-ion phosphate batteries, and a number of other areas. What we see is a declining production over time, and probably a restriction of availability into the phosphate fertilizer market.

460,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today. Mosaic delivered excellent results in the quarter with revenues up almost 30% year-over-year and the gross margin rate at the highest level since early [Technical Difficulty] and our momentum continues to build. Higher fertilizer prices driven by very strong global demand, tight supply and excellent agricultural fundamentals combined with our significantly improved cost structure lead us through a positive outlook for the remainder of the year. Laura, let's get on to the analyst questions.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
461,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, we have received several questions about nutrient affordability, its impact on demand and sensitivity to commodity prices. Specifically how elastic does developed market demand tend to be? And how much application elasticity do you see in emerging markets?']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
462,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you. Generally speaking, within normal ranges grower demand for fertilizer is relatively priced in elastic, whether that would be in developed or emerging markets. Accepting that changes to demand would then be driven by acreage and by yield expectations. However, growers will look at the return on investment of fertilizer applications and particularly if prices of crops are elevated or conversely if they're down, they will adjust their rates higher or lower in order to maximize their yield potential. It certainly appears that last year and now this year, we're seeing signs of some of those upward adjustments to application rates. In India, maximum retail price is set by the government as such Indian farmer affordability may be negatively impacted this year.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
463,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, a few of our analysts had questions regarding our phosphate sales volumes during the quarter. P.J. Juvekar from Citi and Vincent Andrews of Morgan Stanley both asked about our sales volumes being higher than our production volumes despite lower inventories and raw material constraints. Did Mosaic drive down further inventories? And will that offset the sulfur impact?']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
464,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you gentlemen. Our inventories do continue to be below typical levels for this time of the year, but you must understand that this is normally the time of the year where strong spring demand means we will run down our inventory and that's typical at most years. At the end of the quarter, we certainly had lower than normal inventories. However, we also relied on 100,000 tons per month that flowed through the phosphate segment.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
465,Laura Gagnon,['John Roberts of UBS and Joel Jackson of BMO asked for additional color around the sulfur market specifically is the sulfur shortage only a North American phenomenon or sulfur prices going up elsewhere also? Do we think the situation could extend into the second half of the year? And what plans do we have in place to resolve the Q2 sulfur shortage?'],management_discussion,MOS_186340
466,Joc O'Rourke,"['Thank you gentlemen. This year, the molten sulfur supply was constrained due to COVID impacts on refineries. And this was exacerbated in that freeze at the February of 2021. So when you ask is this a local or global issue? Certainly sulfur is played around the world, but particularly molten sulfur is very tight right now. So you will see that we actually melted more in our melters than we normally would and that was actually up 27% from a normal of about 20%. Now, we do expect U.S. refinery activity to recover in the second half, which would take us back to more normal levels.']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
467,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, Michael Piken of Cleveland Research, Ben Isaacson of Scotia, Andrew Wong of RBC, and Steve Byrne of Bank of America, all asked for an updated on Canpotex negotiations with China. In particular, they asked that with the domestic potash price in China now well over $100 per ton higher than the last import contract price and about $100 per ton about the recent India contract price. What are the implications for a new contract in late 2021? And what might the effect be on 2022?']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
468,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you. Look Canpotex is committed through quarter three as they've said publicly, and we're seeing strong demand in North America, in Brazil, in Southeast Asia, all of which we're seeing prices go up. And this price strength is also occurring in China spot markets. So we see all of those markets as having high demand, which is shown by Canpotex' tight supply and even in India now which was had an updated contract is now well out of the money and seems to be outdated. So we see all of these things is very positive for the potash market moving forward. And I expect they will lead to an earlier and more constructive settlement with the Chinese at some point in the fall or early next year.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
469,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, I have a two part question here. Michael Piken of Cleveland and Adrien Tamagno of Berenberg and Ben Isaacson of Scotia have all asked about Mosaic Fertilizantes. First, do you have guidance for Mosaic Fertilizantes from a pricing and margin standpoint? Or how should we think about pricing and margin progression as Fertilizantes?']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
470,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you. While we don't give specific guidance for Mosaic Fertilizantes, we have said that out of the pricing sensitivity we provide in our earnings materials per DAP about 20% of that enterprise impact occurs in Mosaic Fertilizantes. Now, also we have historically seen distribution margins in the range of $25 to $40 per ton. We believe that those two together should give you the information you need to model our [indiscernible] business. In terms of cost, our quarter one was impacted by a few short-term issues related to mine productivity and lower conversion rates, which are temporary in nature and should improve throughout the year. Also remember there are actions being taken for COVID the will impact our costs short-term in Brazil as they are in a fairly serious spot with COVID right now. Finally, depreciation of the Brazilian real has offset the increase in inflationary pressures that we're seeing there.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
471,Laura Gagnon,"['The second part to that question, Joc, was a follow-up. Could you discuss seeming disconnect between the magnitude of price appreciation per MAP versus a much smaller increase in average realized selling prices for Mosaic Fertilizantes sales.']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
472,Joc O'Rourke,"['Thank you. Our average selling price includes blends that have a significant amount of nitrogen, potash and lower grade phosphate materials in them. Portion of which will vary throughout the season, and can have a real impact on our realized pricing. Beyond that a significant portion of Q1 sales were committed in Q4, which contributed to the pricing lag and that is typical in Brazil due to – constraints in that country.']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
473,Laura Gagnon,"[""Joc, we have received several questions on India in particular, John Roberts from UBS and Andrew Wong of RBC asked about our outlook for India's agriculture business, fertilizer demand and nutrient affordability resulting from higher retail prices. They would also like to know if COVID is having any impact.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
474,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thanks, gentlemen. Look good monsoons and [Technical Difficulty], and even still attractive crop prices continue to point a favorable farmer economics in India. Certainly, COVID is disrupting activity as the country goes into lockdown. And we've seen a bit of a pause in the near-term activities. So we're waiting to see how the country addresses recent outbreaks. While COVID is a near-term headwind, the underlying demand for nutrients remains significant as indicated by the extremely low inventories and still strong crop prices. We will not speculate on subsidy changes, but believe the government is committed to maintaining domestic food security.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
475,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, P.J. Juvekar of Citi, Seth Goldstein of Morningstar and Michael Piken of Cleveland Research have all asked for thoughts on Chinese phosphate supply and demand. What are our expectations for Chinese phosphate exports in 2021? And are we concerned that attractive pricing could lead to higher operating rates?']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
476,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you. Our base case for 2021 shows phosphate exports relatively unchanged, and we expect them to stay at around a 9.3 million tons we saw in 2020. Now clearly and even the latest reports show, the operating rates in China are up probably exceeding 80%, but most of that is going to internal demand inside the country. So we have seen so far exports that are right on our expected target. Also, there have been several structural changes that occurred last year in China. And I'm going to let Jenny just give a little bit of background on some of the major ones there.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
477,Jenny Wang,"[""Sure, Joc. We're seeing some structure changes in the Chinese phosphates in The Streets since last year. On the supply side, the Chinese largest producer of DPC didn't have shifted their production from producing DAP, MAP fertilizer to other industrialized new sales P205. For example, they have shifted production to purify [indiscernible], and not only for use of in the food industry, but also in the emerging growth of electrical vehicle and their participations of demand to the batteries. We see this is going to continue in 2021 and going forward. Therefore, we are going to see less P205 to be produced at DAP and MAP. That change is really on the demand side. Domestic phosphates has grown in 2020 which has hit most of the increased production in Q1 at home, therefore we see really little export increases in first quarter."", 'Over to you Joc.']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
478,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, follow up on this topic, John Roberts and Ben Isaacson both asked about the marginal cost phosphate producers, specifically have cost for marginal producers trust with phosphate pricing.']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
479,Joc O'Rourke,"['Thank you. Price increases for the integrated producers have largely outpaced production cost increases, including those in China to the point that most Chinese producers there are experiencing good margins despite higher raw material costs. So now the marginal cost producers are predominantly the non-integrated producers in India, and particularly those that are reliant on imported phosphoric acid. Their DAP production costs of the new Q2 phosphoric acid contract price of $998 per ton is about $615 per ton or about $50 per ton higher than the Indian imported DAP price.']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
480,Laura Gagnon,"[""Joc, we have two questions on global distribution businesses. First, Mark Connelly from Stephens asked what's good across the cycle margin assumption for distribution is now even our operational improvements in growth.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
481,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, mark. Historically, we've targeted around $25 a ton for our distribution business, but we have seen that improved with economies of scale and efficiencies and we've seen that margin expand recently. Scale matters and this has led to this quarter's margin of $40 a ton and even higher for our combined business in India and China.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
482,Laura Gagnon,['Andrew Wong of RBC also asked what China and India distribution contribute to earnings.'],management_discussion,MOS_186340
483,Joc O'Rourke,"['Thank you, Andrew. In this quarter, we have a combined gross margin of the two businesses inside around $30 million. And but we have to understand that that margin was in half by the upward trajectory of phosphate and potash, which allowed for profit from the inventory that was held by those businesses.']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
484,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, we have a few questions on free cash flow generation and capital allocation. First, Vincent Andrews asks why net income increased by $300 million quarter-over-quarter, but cash flow from operations only increased by $130 million. What are the drivers and cash flow from operations this year versus last?']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
485,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Vincent. I'm going to hand this straight over to Clint to talk about our cash flow.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
486,Clint Freeland,"[""Thanks, Joc, and good morning, Vincent. I think there are – specific to the year-over-year, I think a large part of that is inventory movements between the two years. Last year, we were – if you recall, we had very significant inventories where we're liquidating some of those excess inventories where this year our inventory is built by about $180 million mostly in Brazil and Canada. So I think a year-over-year comparison that's what's driving a lot of it, but also recall that every year during the first quarter there are some pretty meaningful accruals that are actually paid out in the first quarter. Those accruals primarily being some tax accruals from the previous year that actually pay out and hit our free cash flow in the first quarter of every year, as well as our short-term incentive accruals that again or accrued previous year, but paid out in the first quarter of every year. So that's just something to keep in mind that are recurring things in the first quarter of each year.""]",management_discussion,MOS_186340
487,Laura Gagnon,"['Second related question comes from Ben Isaacson of Scotia, who asks if Mosaic has revised its thoughts on capital allocation, given the strong free cash flow Mosaic will generate this year, especially as K3 CapEx winds down?']",management_discussion,MOS_186340
488,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Ben. The simple answer here is no we're not changing our priorities. We continue to have our approach to capital allocation, which balances debt repayment, return to shareholders and investing in the business in high return quick payback projects. And there is a couple of things I'd like to highlight here out. Earlier this year, we increased the dividend by 50%. We've committed to paying down $450 million of long-term debt that comes due in November."", ""And the other piece is we've had a number of really good return projects in our transformation. And we continue to invest small, but meaningfully in those high return quick payback projects. So, we completely remain committed to doing exactly what we've said all along, which is balancing off all of our positions. And frankly, that's what our investors have said they of us. Thank you.

How much volume have you sold forward and maybe more broadly? How would you characterize the demand outlook into the fall at this point, relative to historical levels – in ag cycle causing that distribution channel to aggressively want to rebuild inventories? Or is there a risk that we could see a pullback and more of a wait and see until later in the year?""]",question_answer,MOS_186340
497,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Yes. Thanks, Steve. Again, I apologize for the loss of connection for a few seconds. Yes, in terms of the forward order book, if you will, I suspect what you're referring to is – I think late last week we started to have people come to us with summer fill needs. So the spring season is basically finished from our perspective and now some of the larger retailers have come to us, looking for a positioning material for the fall. It is a little early for a fall program. And frankly, we think that prices were we expected some little dip in prices as you go into the summer low, but with the tightness that is in the market globally. And then in North America, we're starting to see people come to the market earlier. So we were looking at this as a very good sign and a good sign for an early and aggressive fall application season.""]",question_answer,MOS_186340

499,Adam Samuelson,"[""Yes, thanks. Good morning, maybe along the similar line Joc. I'm just trying to think about your phosphate realizations and the gap in your, kind of what you're talking about in terms of your second quarter price improvement versus what we're seeing in the pricing out of Tampa or NOLA. It seems like the benchmark prices have gone up more. Is that a function of the volume shortfall and pretty committed tons? I'm just trying to make sure we're understanding the gap there seems to be wider versus the published benchmarks in the ministry?""]",question_answer,MOS_186340
500,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Yes. Thanks, Adam. Well, I think, there's a couple of things there. Of course, there was great demand earlier in the spring season than usual, I think, because of the low inventories we start off with. But so there is always a big lag in this as we sell early Q1, even Q4, we're not rev wrecking them until well into this quarter. So there's always that, and then there's the people who are buying early and that's when they – when the prices gets that when they buy."", ""So if we look at the ending price or the high prices in the 590, it was only there for a short period of time. And it was probably for the just in time deliveries, as opposed to the people who'd planned better. So we expect now we're going to see Q3 average net paybacks raise again, as we sell into the summer fill. And basically, we'll move into the – into the fall with that and we don't have much lower price to carry over anymore. So the light will decrease.""]",question_answer,MOS_186340

503,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Yes. Thanks. Well, look the way I would probably characterize this as I'd like to see the money in the bank before we talk about how we're going to spend it. So our first priorities continue to be that. We've talked about the paying down debt. We've talked about the priorities being the returning money to shareholders, and we're not going to rush out and spend a bunch of money on anything until, and if the right opportunity comes where we believe that we can add real value and get an extraordinary return for the shareholders. So, I wouldn't think about any of those, three is being our priority.

Start by saying there have been a number of new importers into the U.S. such that I think quarter one volume of imports into the U.S. were pretty much on par with what they were here. So it's not that we've got less important. It's just; we have different importers or different people coming into this market. In terms of OCP and Russians, I mean, they're welcomed to come into this market, but it doesn't really make sense with a OCP, with a 20% tariff that they wouldn't go to a market – another market like India or whatever, which is not being tariffed right now.

509,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Yes. Thanks, Joel. Well, I think we said before that we would certainly look at participating if Vale's sharers came to the market.

531,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Okay. Thanks, Rikin. Well, let me start with our potash. If we look at the expectations on potash this year, I'd start by saying North American demand appears to be very strong and that's one of the gain areas. Brazil will be strong; again we're expecting record use of fertilizer in Brazil it seems year-after-year. We're seeing a big rebound, let's call it in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, Malaysia with their Palm oil, but all the way across Southeast Asia – all the way across Asia, we're seeing good demand. And again, that's probably the only place where it'll be flat year-on-year is probably going to be India. And although we expect a decrease in phosphate use, we sort of expect use in potash. So overall that would be the – those would be the drivers. And if those do better, we could get up to the 71, otherwise we'll probably be more in the 69 to 70 range is kind of our base case."", ""In terms of decarburization if you will, we set some fairly aggressive ESG targets. We said we would reduce our greenhouse gases by about 20%. Sorry, we would decrease our greenhouse gases by 20%, a lot of what we're doing there involves how we're running our phosphate businesses. We've put a lot of effort and resources into to how we can use recycled heat to make power. And over time we see that along with just other uses to use less power et cetera, in terms of the nitrogen, I guess a couple of the nitrogen producers are talking about bringing that and glue nitrogen. At this stage, those really haven't got to the market yet.

Last week, the Department of Commerce announced final duty rates in the CVD case, having adjusted them from the preliminary rates that we announced in November. The final rates are about 20% for OCP, 9% for PhosAgro and 47% for EuroChem. We really appreciate the work the Department of Commerce has done in this investigation and its efforts to enforce our trade laws. We're closely reviewing their findings to determine whether additional upward adjustments are required. Also last week, the International Trade Commission held its public full day hearing.

544,Clint Freeland,"[""Thanks, Joc. Maybe I'll start with the second question and then move back to Jonas' question afterwards. So related to the tax benefit associated with the Vale acquisitions, when we acquired the Brazil business in 2018, it came with certain tax assets. That we ended up having to put a valuation allowance against, given the historic profitability of that subsidiary, that just according to GAAP rules. What's now transpired is that, that - the profitability of that subsidiary has improved to the point where under GAAP accounting, we can now remove that valuation allowance and affected our GAAP earnings for the year."", ""Now to Jonas' question around our effective tax rate for the year, we actually realized some foreign tax benefits in the fourth quarter that we had originally thought would be temporary in nature and reported on the balance sheet. But as we concluded our analysis, we got our opinions and finished our work, it became apparent that those foreign tax benefits were going to be permanent. And when that's the case, you need to take it through the income statement through P&L on the tax line. When we look at where our earnings and earnings mix came out for the year, which provided a lot - quite a bit of volatility in our rate last year, all of that came out as expected, but as we again concluded our work on these foreign tax benefits and recognize that they were going to be eminent, we ended up needing to, again, run that through the tax line, and that's what brought our effective tax rate down to the level that we recorded."", 'As we go forward into 2021, a couple of things to keep in mind. First, the foreign tax benefits that we recognized in 2020, we expect that to continue to benefit our rate in future years. The other thing to keep in mind is that the better our phosphate business does, the more income is generated in the United States, which is our lowest tax jurisdiction.

546,James O'Rourke,"['Thank you, folks. Soft commodity prices are at multiyear highs, and the expectation is that these strong ag economics will continue. So what that applies for us is continuing strong demand for fertilizers as farmers seek to maximize their production. Our quarter 4 shipments were definitely strong and they lowered our inventories even further, which means that we will be constrained by production capacity as we move into 2021. That said, our phosphate volumes are expected to include up to 150,000 tonnes from our joint venture, MWSPC, and we will bring to NOLA that as we work to meet the U.S. customer needs. As a result, we expect our quarter 1 shipments to be in line with historical performance as we work to meet what is pretty strong demand despite the strong volumes, we saw in quarter 4.', ""A few extra things to consider. In both phosphates and potash, we will maximize our production at operating facilities, but we don't expect to be able to build our own inventories prior to the North American spring season.

A number of analysts, including Duffy Fischer from Barclays; Chris Parkinson from Crédit Suisse; Andrew Wong from RBC; and Steve Byrne from Bank of America have all asked about the China and Indian contracts. Canpotex and other producers have been publicly critical of the recent BPC contract settlement. Typically when one producer settles at a certain price, other producers shortly [indiscernible]. Can you talk about why that's the case? Why haven't other producers in the past held out for higher prices? And for this year, specifically, will the situation end up differently? Do you expect others to hold? And how do you think of the economics at this price?""]",question_answer,MOS_182403
552,James O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, folks. Look, I think the surprising outcome here is really centered around the Indian contract, where BPC was the first mover. And as you've heard from other suppliers, including Canpotex, settled at a price that was, what we believe, lower than what market fundamentals were pointing towards. From our perspective, the price doesn't represent the reality we're seeing or the tightness of the market and pricing and other jurisdictions highlights this. I can only speculate as to what motivated BPC to do that. But given the political uncertainty in Belarus over the last year, there may have been nonmarket drivers that played into it."", ""In terms of Mosaic, given that we sell internationally through Canpotex, we're going to allow Canpotex to do what it was set out to do. And therefore, we won't be negotiating contracts on our own or on calls like this. But it is important to keep in mind that contracts involve, prices, volumes, grades and durations. Not to mention any number of other terms, which can impact producer economics and which we believe will come into play given how tight the market is.

What is your expectation for exports for 2021? And how do they align with recoveries from COVID curtailments, potential demand destruction from high prices and the government's latest initiative to increase phosphate operating rates?""]",question_answer,MOS_182403
554,James O'Rourke,"[""Thank you. What we saw last year with regard to Chinese exports is they fell by approximately 800,000 tonnes, down to 9.3 million total tonnes. From a capacity standpoint, we believe capacity was reduced by - in 2020 by roughly 1 million tonnes year-over-year, both due to closures and product mix shifting. This was in line with our expectations, and we'd characterize that magnitude is significant. It is expected that in 2021, capacity is going to be stable, but at the same time, domestic demand is likely to increase once again. And our fairly conservative export forecast may be too high. The Chinese government has indicated the desire to increase phosphate operating rates. Our analysis already points to a relatively high operating rate in the Chinese effective capacity. So even if we were to assume a dramatic step higher in Chinese utilization of, say, 5 percentage points, that would increase export availability by no more than 1 million tonnes. And upside growth in domestic demand could easily absorb a portion of those tonnes.""]",question_answer,MOS_182403

It's normal to see a decline from quarter 3 to quarter 4. This year, though, it's probably exacerbated by additional impact of delaying our [indiscernible], which negatively impact our fixed cost absorption. The movement of the Brazilian real from 5.6 [Technical Difficulty] the end of the quarter also caused a noncash, noneconomic translational impact in the COGS, lowering gross margin by about $13 million.

And what I mean by that is, are some of the conclusions of the Department of Commerce taken as premises for the decisions that the ITC will make? Or is none of their analysis taken as a premise? And secondly, your equity loss really dropped in the fourth quarter. Do you expect your equity income to be positive in 2021?""]",question_answer,MOS_182403
583,James O'Rourke,"[""Sorry. Yes, Jeff, thank you. Let me take that in 2 pieces, obviously. First of all, in terms of the Department of Commerce and the ITC, they are independent and their determination is meant to be independent. So the DoC decides the level of subsidization and the ITC decides whether or not that the presence of those imports has caused harm to the U.S. industry. So technically, I guess they're not related, but I suppose there's got to be some element of relationship that says, well, if you have subsidized material coming in and it harms you, that there's a problem. So technically though, I don't believe they're related directly. In terms of the equity loss, most of that is Ma'aden and I think we've talked about before where Ma'aden is delayed by 1 quarter. So we report our equity earnings or losses from Ma'aden a quarter in arrears. And so if you look at the global price of phosphates today, I would expect certainly a much lower equity loss or for that to turn to a gain at some point.

Can you talk about kind of the cost side? I mean you should have pretty good line of sight to how the ammonia and sulfur input cost moves kind of would impact the first quarter kind of cash margin. And help us think about how you'd frame the first half or even 2021, if you could just from an ammonia, sulfur kind of the movement on the input cost side so we can be thoughtful about calibrating to benchmark pricing.""]",question_answer,MOS_182403
586,James O'Rourke,"[""Yes. Thank you, Adam. Certainly, as you say, there is a lag, and we've talked about it. In terms of lag in sulfur, there's also a lag for both sulfur [Technical Difficulty] for ammonia. What I would point you to there, I guess, is just the stoichiometric requirement. Our need for ammonia represents about [Technical Difficulty] tonnes per tonne of DAP produced. Our use of sulfur represents about 0.4 tonnes of sulfur for every tonne of DAP produced. So as you can see what that means, if sulfur moves from the $60 to the $90 some that it's at today, a $30 increase in sulfur is going to add something like a $12 increase to our overall price. So in sulfur, you should be able to take fairly much the Gulf price or our quarterly price and work that in. In terms of ammonia, again, same thing, except that, obviously, we produce 1/3 of our ammonia. So that is at normal cost. 1/3 of our ammonia is - 1/3 or so of our ammonia is produced by CF on a long-term contract. And then we only buy about 1/4 of our - 1/4 to 1/3 of our ammonia on spot.

And it looks like, I think we'll be telling you soon probably slightly under budget. So for a 10-year project or an 8-year project, that's a pretty pleasing outcome. In terms of the design, we expected to produce an extra million tonnes of potash from K3 when it was at full production. That amounts to about 3 million tonnes of incremental ore. So when we say we'll be up to 3 million tonnes, that means we'll be running virtually the whole incremental capacity of K3. Now what happens after that is K3 slowly takes over all production at the Esterhazy facility over the next couple of years. And what does that do for cost? The cost of - first of all, the cost of production instead of producing it, let's say, at Colonsay, we have all the fixed costs. This is all coming in as incremental tonnes.

How much premium has been built into the U.S. phosphate prices from the absence of Moroccan and Russian imports? And how will a reduction in the NOLA global parity premium affect your margins? In other words, what would the $50 price increase you expect to realize in the fourth quarter be if the U.S. was at parity today?']",management_discussion,MOS_177486
613,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, gentlemen. Prices are up globally. Our realizations reflect India prices up over 20% and Brazil prices up 30%, despite increasing imports in both those jurisdictions from Morocco and Russia. While global parity may be less than where NOLA is trading today, it would be significantly higher than where it was trading in June. There seems to be an increasing common misconception somehow that CVD petition is impacting global supply. Market prices are driven by strong supply and demand, not the CVD, which is expected to change trade flows, not overall market. Our petition was aimed at leveling the playing field for all producers selling in U.S., not to eliminate competition. Moroccan and Russian producers chose to pull back completely from the U.S. market, likely leaving their customers short of product. And they did it to make a political point and express their dissatisfaction over this being considered at all. We are doing all we can to best serve our customers. We have even begun importing tons from Ma’aden, simply to meet our customers’ needs. Longer term, it is not our intention to replace Moroccan and Russian tons with products from Saudi for several reasons, not least of which is from a global logistics perspective. It makes more sense for us to send that product into Asia rather than bring it here, but we’re doing that to help our customers. Longer term, we would expect NOLA to trade at global parity.

As such, we would expect the Russians and the Moroccans to continue to ship to other markets, like India and Brazil. If there is no subsidy, we would expect the trade flows to return to what they were pre-CVD filing. Remember, the Russians and the Moroccans made the decision to pull out of these markets altogether when petition was filed. So, we will continue to serve our customers.

Now, it’s important to remember that DAP MAP production in China continues to trend lower.

Purified phosphoric acid from the wet process is replacing the highly-polluting thermal process, which is also the outcome of the stringent environmental protection measurements and is ongoing. According to China phosphate industry association, 5 million tons of DAP MAP production capacity has been lost since the environmental protection measures have been implemented.

Look, current farmer economics are very strong, particularly in Brazil, and are expected to push Brazilian demand grow higher again in 2021, probably in the 2% to 3% year-over-year. This is the fundamental driver. As for La Nina, it’s not something that we’re overly concerned with, unless it were persistent through mid-2021. The reason for this is, the strong growth signals from La Nina for Argentina and Southern Brazil is typical from June to August. And what we saw in recent months could have been a signal persisting a bit longer than is typical or it may have been simply dry weather patterns in South Americas at large. Importantly for Brazil though, rains have improved and planting is progressing. The delays were a couple of weeks. So, we do expect to see no impact on total demand. Demand is expected to remain very strong, aligned with good farmer profitability.

First, production, where the price of finished goods, raw materials and cost to produce drive gross margins. Here, we are continuing to driving production costs down, and through transformation, continuing to improve that business. In distribution, where we earn a margin that is impacted by volume, economy of scale and pricing trends, we continue, as well as transformation and continued improvements in our performance product sales.

But also, recall that against our existing AROs, we also have about a $700 million escrow account that will offset at least a portion of that spend in future years. Now, related to the environmental reserve that we booked this quarter, that’s really related to some subsurface work that we need to do at some of our facilities around some of our gypstacks. And I would say, specific to that that spend is probably going to be made over the next two to four years.']",management_discussion,MOS_177486

So, you have a fair amount of information in your deck on the demand outlook for ‘21, somewhere between flat with 2020 or maybe up 2 million tons. But, if we look at your supply outlook and you have a breakdown of what we see as potentially the delta in supply from ‘21 to ‘20, there’s a few fairly large items in there, and just we’d like to hear your view as to the up and downside risk to some of those, the big ones being an inventory build is expected by the producers, the ramp-up at OCP, and then the recovery in supply, given the 2020 outages. Those three are the fairly large line items. Is there a potential risk that those are much bigger than that?']",question_answer,MOS_177486
647,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Steve. Well, let me start by saying, as we look into 2021, we do believe that the phosphate S&D is quite tight. So, first of all, we’ll end this year with relatively low inventories, and that’s relatively low inventories throughout the channel. Our proxy kind of indicates U.S. inventory will be down about 35%, which represents somewhere in that 600,000 tons mark. India will be down as much as 1.3 million tons and China down as much as 700,000 tons. So, as we look at how we enter this year, we do believe that some of the production will have to go into rebuilding distribution stocks to fully service this market. And then, if we look at the increases, there’s a couple of things that are important. First of all, with that level of inventory at the end of the year, we do expect that the -- will be a higher utilization of assets, which is where we have the million tons of recovered production, if you will. So, if we look at those two, they relatively offset themselves that we need to increase inventory just to supply basic needs and have a normally balanced market, but we also will have the opportunity to run assets harder. In terms of the go-forward, we’ve heard from OCP publicly that they will be relatively slower in bringing on new production. They’ve announced that publicly. So, we see modest increases to new productions coming from improvements in Ma’aden, as they continue to move their Wa’ad Al Shamal operation up to full production over the next year or two, and then modest increases from OCP. And I think the rest are fairly minor in nature. So, I wouldn’t really worry too much about those, one way or another. But overall, we do see a tightening market for next year.']",question_answer,MOS_177486

So, first of all, I would say, there’s been a relative rebound in demand as was expected. Some of the highlights, though, I would like to put out is, as you mentioned, China has been a really good highlight, as has India in both of those markets for reasons of food security and probably trying to make sure that they produce as much in-country as they can. Demand for potash has been strong in both of those jurisdictions. And then, in the rest of Asia, the big thing there, of course, is Indonesia, Malaysia and the demand for palm oil, which has really bumped up.

But, there’s continued focus on food security and ensuring that they have a robust agricultural industry to ensure the less reliance on outside places. So, for doing that, we expect that actually potash demand will increase internally, because the corn demand is so strong. But also, the other 1 is, their own internal production at Shanghai Lake is reaching its capacity and possibly even going down. So, we do expect China to be a, let’s call it, a growth engine for next year. In terms of phosphate exports, I think, as I said, there’s a couple of closures. So, there has been some structural changes in the phosphate market in China.

661,Joc O’Rourke,"['Well, I’m going to have to be fairly direct on this answer, Adam. And let me start by saying, I suspect the market has been impacted by statements made by one of our competitors and their impairment of their phosphate business. So, let me be relatively direct with this. First of all, an impairment needs to be driven by a triggering event, at least that’s my standing of general accounting practices or IFRS. When I look at the potential triggering events, the one thing I can say is that phosphate prices are up significantly quarter-over-quarter. And if I look at the outside consultants that we use like CRU, their long-term estimates are also up. So, it is very difficult for me to see how long-term phosphate outlook was the triggering event for this write-down. So, as such, you asked me what I -- what we’re getting wrong. I think, people are taking the idea that the triggering event was the phosphate market, where clearly it had to be something different than that, and they’re assuming that means we have a poor outlook. Now, what I will say is, if you compare the two businesses, we are very -- difficult to compare them one-to-one. First of all, we’re very different in scale, but we also sell very different products. They sell purified phosphoric acid, which is being highly impacted in the industrial sector by two things. One, the economy is slowing down; and the other, by external competition. Now if I look -- compare that to fertilizers, fertilizers is actually quite the opposite. We’ve seen an increase in demand, we’ve seen an increase in pricing, and we see a very good outlook. So, I don’t think you can compare the two businesses. And I certainly don’t think phosphate demand and supply, at least for fertilizers is a factor in that, so.']",question_answer,MOS_177486

I’d just be curious to hear your thoughts on that.']",question_answer,MOS_177486
664,Joc O’Rourke,"['Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Look, you’re absolutely right. This is about trade flows, not overall supply and demand. So today, what the Russians and the Moroccans have done is they have redirected tons that would have otherwise come to the U.S. to either Brazil, India or in some cases, Eastern Canada. So, they have moved a number of tons to different markets. They have not sold significantly different number of tons globally than they have in any other year. So, we know that their overall supply and demand balance in the world has been very similar. So, where they pull tons out of the U.S., we’ve had to bring more tons into the U.S. to serve it, but you’re also seeing tons come from places that haven’t historically set tons to the U.S., like Australia and Mexico or significant tonnage in terms of that. So, you do see a difference in trade flows. So, what would happen if that reversed, my expectation is the reversal would create exactly the opposite. We would see more tons going from Mosaic to our Brazil business. We would see more tons going to India from our Saudi tonnage, et cetera, and there would be other imports coming into the U.S. So overall, we don’t think that this is going to make a huge difference.

First of all, let me say, the weakening real, if it’s had a biggest impact, it has been on the profitability of the Brazilian farmer. So, that has really been what’s driving a great demand picture in Brazil. So, the Brazilian farmer is doing very well. If you look at it in terms of our business, what we would expect is our distribution business is relatively independent of the real pricing. And the reason for that is, we buy on U.S. dollars, we sell -- we then hedge that and convert to a Brazilian real number. So, really, it doesn’t have a huge effect on our overall margins. What it does is it makes a difference to the actual demand. In terms of our production business though, obviously, on the shorter term, wages and everything else, Brazil real-based costs go down fairly quickly. So, we do see an improvement in cost and a better margin for our production business. What I will say, though, is if I look at the last couple of quarters, the Brazilian real has been essentially flat. If I look at our statistics for the last two quarters, we’re 5.37% versus this quarter of 5.38%. So, essentially, they’ve been perfectly flat.

692,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thanks for joining us today for our quarter three 2020 question-and-answer session. Before we get started, I would like to emphasize our key points from our quarterly earnings report. First, we’re realizing the benefits of our extensive cost transformation work. Gross margin for the quarter was 27% compared with a year ago, despite essentially flat fertilizer prices. Secondly, agriculture and fertilizer markets around the globe are strong and improving. Phosphate prices are up substantially, while potash prices are stable. We expect global supply and demand to remain tight in all of 2021. And third, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. We have repaid all the short-term debt we borrowed to be prepared for COVID impacts, and the business is generating substantial cash.', 'Now, we’ll get to your questions. Laura?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
693,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, I’m going to try to go through the most frequently asked questions fairly rapidly to allow time for follow-up questions after. The largest number of questions we received last night related to phosphates markets and the countervailing duty petition.', 'PJ Juvekar from Citi, Joel Jackson from BMO, and Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs are all asking about the impact of trade flow shift. How much premium has been built into the U.S. phosphate prices from the absence of Moroccan and Russian imports? And how will a reduction in the NOLA global parity premium affect your margins? In other words, what would the $50 price increase you expect to realize in the fourth quarter be if the U.S. was at parity today?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
694,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, gentlemen. Prices are up globally. Our realizations reflect India prices up over 20% and Brazil prices up 30%, despite increasing imports in both those jurisdictions from Morocco and Russia. While global parity may be less than where NOLA is trading today, it would be significantly higher than where it was trading in June. There seems to be an increasing common misconception somehow that CVD petition is impacting global supply. Market prices are driven by strong supply and demand, not the CVD, which is expected to change trade flows, not overall market. Our petition was aimed at leveling the playing field for all producers selling in U.S., not to eliminate competition.', 'Moroccan and Russian producers chose to pull back completely from the U.S. market, likely leaving their customers short of product. And they did it to make a political point and express their dissatisfaction over this being considered at all. We are doing all we can to best serve our customers. We have even begun importing tons from Ma’aden, simply to meet our customers’ needs. Longer term, it is not our intention to replace Moroccan and Russian tons with products from Saudi for several reasons, not least of which is from a global logistics perspective. It makes more sense for us to send that product into Asia rather than bring it here, but we’re doing that to help our customers. Longer term, we would expect NOLA to trade at global parity. Recognize that global parity prices today are significantly above where they were in June.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
695,Laura Gagnon,"['Another trade full question comes from PJ. If exports from Morocco and Russia are ending up in India and Brazil, why are prices up there?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
696,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you. The global supply and demand is stronger than many realized a few months ago. Economic tightness in the market is driving global prices up. Supply has tightened. China exports are down, and we started 2020 with curtailments, including COVID-driven outages. On the demand side, the agricultural economy globally is strong. Food security has become a great priority around the world, and fertilizers are very affordable.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
697,Laura Gagnon,['We have a question from Ben Isaacson from Scotia; and John Roberts from UBS. They’re both asking about phosphate pricing momentum. September realized prices improved 11% from August. Did that momentum continue? And how much more upside do you see for the phosphate market?'],management_discussion,MOS_2960104
698,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you. We’ve continued to see prices increase into October and November, and seeing good demand as we move into of 2021. We expect to end this fall with very low inventories, which bodes well for the spring season and winter. So, we are seeing a normal seasonal slowdown, but we expect strong markets to continue into 2021.

699,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, both Chris Parkinson of Credit Suisse, and Joel Jackson of BMO, and others are asking for potential impacts following the ITC DOC determinations. In particular, how will no, low and high duties impact our strategy, and who will fill the void if U.S. imports?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
700,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, gentlemen. Remember, the November determination is simply if there are subsidies. In the first quarter, the decision is the determination of harm and the identification of duty, if anything. If it is determined that there is going to be a high duty, we would expect the trade flows to change to account for that. As such, we would expect the Russians and the Moroccans to continue to ship to other markets, like India and Brazil. If there is no subsidy, we would expect the trade flows to return to what they were pre-CVD filing. Remember, the Russians and the Moroccans made the decision to pull out of these markets altogether when petition was filed. So, we will continue to serve our customers. If there is more product required for Brazil and India, we will redirect tons to those markets. If we continue to see a deficiency in the North American market, we will divert tons to that market.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
701,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, we’ve received a number of questions related to the broader phosphate market supply and demand, in particular with respect to the Chinese phosphate industry. PJ Juvekar from Citi asks, what are your estimates of phosphate exports out of China in 2020?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
702,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, PJ. We’ve said and we continue to believe that Chinese exports will be down by more than 500,000 tons this year. Our latest estimate is that they will actually be down by more like 700,000 tons. From January to September, exports were down by nearly 1 million tons. Now, it’s important to remember that DAP MAP production in China continues to trend lower. Quarter one to quarter three, it was down by, call it 1.4 million tons, while domestic demand now appears to be stabilizing. That means Chinese exports are going to be constrained in the future.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
703,Laura Gagnon,"['Jonas Oxgaard asks, how confident are you that the three facilities closed in China are permanently closed?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
704,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Jonas. For the three facilities closed in 2019, we are confident they are not coming back to DAP map production. One was permanently closed; one was in the process of relocation to a different place and is planned to be built as a water-soluble fertilizer production facility; and the third shifted its production to industrial-grade purified phosphoric acid. Purified phosphoric acid from the wet process is replacing the highly-polluting thermal process, which is also the outcome of the stringent environmental protection measurements and is ongoing.', 'According to China phosphate industry association, 5 million tons of DAP MAP production capacity has been lost since the environmental protection measures have been implemented. This includes permanent closure, relocation for different production and strategic production shifts to a higher-value products, like purified phosphoric acid.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104

706,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Chris. The estimation to a typical southwest phosphate producers production cost is still around $300 per metric ton, ex plant, and probably an fob equivalent of $335 per metric ton at a Chinese export port.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
707,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, the second most popular area of questions was Mosaic Fertilizantes. Mark Connelly specifically addressed this question to you. After you acquired Fertilizantes, you told us that there were no really big cost reduction projects, but rather a large number of small to midsized projects, many of which were suggested by local employees. Are the sort of projects you are doing today materially different in expected returns? And among these, has the transfer of best practices between and among your Brazil plants proceeded as well as the early projects did?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
708,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Mark. Let me say, we continue to see a number of small to medium-sized, high-benefit projects, and transformation continues to drive benefits with very little capital and very high returns for Mosaic Fertilizantes. Now, as we go forward, some of these will require incremental growth capital, mostly technology-related, and much of that is like our next-gen mining investment in Florida. Now, what I would ask is, we’re going to go into depth of this, and our transformation growth objectives for Mosaic Fertilizantes next Monday, November 9th. So please, stay tuned then, and we’ll give you a lot more detail of where we believe this business is going and the potential for our growth in South America.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
709,Laura Gagnon,['Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs; and Andrew Wong from RBC both asked about the demand outlook. How does the interplay of current farmer economics and La Nina weather forecasts impact the Brazilian demand outlook? And did the very high Q3 phosphates demand pull volumes from Q4?'],management_discussion,MOS_2960104
710,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, both. Look, current farmer economics are very strong, particularly in Brazil, and are expected to push Brazilian demand grow higher again in 2021, probably in the 2% to 3% year-over-year. This is the fundamental driver.', 'As for La Nina, it’s not something that we’re overly concerned with, unless it were persistent through mid-2021. The reason for this is, the strong growth signals from La Nina for Argentina and Southern Brazil is typical from June to August. And what we saw in recent months could have been a signal persisting a bit longer than is typical or it may have been simply dry weather patterns in South Americas at large. Importantly for Brazil though, rains have improved and planting is progressing. The delays were a couple of weeks. So, we do expect to see no impact on total demand. Demand is expected to remain very strong, aligned with good farmer profitability. In terms of your question of moving Q3 phosphates from Q4, we do expect to see continued strong demand in Q4 as the season has been extended by the dry weather that we’ve already seen.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
711,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, Steve Byrne of Bank of America asks, there has been significant productivity extracted from the legacy Vale assets. Are the earnings growth drivers longer-term going to be from geographic expansion, from production capacity expansions in phosphate and potash or from new products and services, such as selling other crop inputs?']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
712,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Steve. Yes. The quick answer is yes. We see great potential in all three of those areas. We are and have a very strong first-mover advantage. We have a great platform in Brazil. And we hope over time to take greater advantage of that. Now today, our primary focus for growth in Mosaic Fertilizantes is organic. We continue to see transformation opportunity. We see increases in co-product sales and benefits from the deployment of technology. There are geographic areas where we feel we have a smaller distribution footprint than we would like, but we also have room to grow with our current distribution assets that we have.', 'So, in summary, we see all areas having potential. We do think that both distribution and production will grow, and we’ll continue to strive our first-mover advantage in that great growing region.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104

714,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Joel. When we’re thinking about our per ton margins, we really have to consider two components. First, production, where the price of finished goods, raw materials and cost to produce drive gross margins. Here, we are continuing to driving production costs down, and through transformation, continuing to improve that business.', 'In distribution, where we earn a margin that is impacted by volume, economy of scale and pricing trends, we continue, as well as transformation and continued improvements in our performance product sales. That’s really how we’re going to drive long-term value. So, in distribution, we do see that holding up well as well as in production. So, on both sides, we expect we can not only hold those margins, but expand them as time goes by.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
715,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, we also got a large number of questions on our phosphate segment. Steve Byrne and PJ Juvekar are both asking about the near-term performance and the expected profitability improvement into the fourth quarter.

719,Clint Freeland,"['Thanks, Joc. As many of you may recall, the third quarter of each year is typically when we update and refresh the estimate to see to work related to ARO activity. And I would say that quite a bit of the amount that we booked this quarter is related to plant city as we’ve learned more about that site over the last year. Our ARO spend is typically spread out over an extended period of time, 40 to 50 years during the life of facilities and gypstack and so forth, so a very extended type of spend profile. But also, recall that against our existing AROs, we also have about a $700 million escrow account that will offset at least a portion of that spend in future years. Now, related to the environmental reserve that we booked this quarter, that’s really related to some subsurface work that we need to do at some of our facilities around some of our gypstacks. And I would say, specific to that that spend is probably going to be made over the next two to four years.']",management_discussion,MOS_2960104
720,Laura Gagnon,"['Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs; and Seth Goldstein from Morningstar are both asking about fourth quarter phosphate volumes.

721,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, gentlemen. As we look at the fourth quarter, we see great demand in all our markets right now. And so, with that, we do expect to have relatively good sales through the quarter and then low inventories as we enter next year. As we look to 2021, we do expect to see a good demand scenario, and we would expect to see good utilization of our assets, particularly, if you remember, in first quarter of 2020, we had bar go down for almost three months.

723,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Ben. Yes, we definitely look at Colonsay as something we would bring back if our customers needed the tons and if the price justified restarting it.

In 2020, K3 is forecasted to produce about 4.4 million tons or the equivalent of about 1.5 million tons of finished product, which amounts to about 15%, 20% of our total production of potash in Canada. In June 2022, K3 or Esterhazy will be providing the ore for approximately 6 million tons of finished goods production, and this will completely replace K1 and K2 mines. So, our expectation is, we will not necessarily grow production, but rather replace K1 and K2. Longer term, our goal is to match production with demand, while also lowering our cost profile.

727,Steve Byrne,"['Hi. I’d like to drill a little more on this phosphate supply and demand outlook that seems to be highly contested today. So, you have a fair amount of information in your deck on the demand outlook for ‘21, somewhere between flat with 2020 or maybe up 2 million tons. But, if we look at your supply outlook and you have a breakdown of what we see as potentially the delta in supply from ‘21 to ‘20, there’s a few fairly large items in there, and just we’d like to hear your view as to the up and downside risk to some of those, the big ones being an inventory build is expected by the producers, the ramp-up at OCP, and then the recovery in supply, given the 2020 outages. Those three are the fairly large line items. Is there a potential risk that those are much bigger than that?']",question_answer,MOS_2960104
728,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Steve. Well, let me start by saying, as we look into 2021, we do believe that the phosphate S&D is quite tight. So, first of all, we’ll end this year with relatively low inventories, and that’s relatively low inventories throughout the channel. Our proxy kind of indicates U.S. inventory will be down about 35%, which represents somewhere in that 600,000 tons mark. India will be down as much as 1.3 million tons and China down as much as 700,000 tons. So, as we look at how we enter this year, we do believe that some of the production will have to go into rebuilding distribution stocks to fully service this market.', 'And then, if we look at the increases, there’s a couple of things that are important. First of all, with that level of inventory at the end of the year, we do expect that the -- will be a higher utilization of assets, which is where we have the million tons of recovered production, if you will. So, if we look at those two, they relatively offset themselves that we need to increase inventory just to supply basic needs and have a normally balanced market, but we also will have the opportunity to run assets harder.', 'In terms of the go-forward, we’ve heard from OCP publicly that they will be relatively slower in bringing on new production. They’ve announced that publicly. So, we see modest increases to new productions coming from improvements in Ma’aden, as they continue to move their Wa’ad Al Shamal operation up to full production over the next year or two, and then modest increases from OCP. And I think the rest are fairly minor in nature. So, I wouldn’t really worry too much about those, one way or another. But overall, we do see a tightening market for next year.']",question_answer,MOS_2960104

We don’t really look at phosphate supply and demand, the rock supply and demand, for the reason that we’re not really involved in that market. Overall, where we -- where that comes about is domestic production in some of the nonintegrated markets like India and whatnot. In terms of our Miski Mayo operation, which we do have an outside production of rock, it’s really for our own use. So, we don’t -- again look at it from that perspective, we assume that really what matters is overall phosphoric acid usage in the global market, and that really drives us.

So, first of all, I would say, there’s been a relative rebound in demand as was expected. Some of the highlights, though, I would like to put out is, as you mentioned, China has been a really good highlight, as has India in both of those markets for reasons of food security and probably trying to make sure that they produce as much in-country as they can. Demand for potash has been strong in both of those jurisdictions. And then, in the rest of Asia, the big thing there, of course, is Indonesia, Malaysia and the demand for palm oil, which has really bumped up.', 'And just to touch on your piece there, biodiesel has been a part of that because where -- biodiesel is going to play a role in fuel as we go forward. And I would like to highlight that in markets like India and China, basic ethanol will also play a role in demand for commodities in those jurisdictions as well.

But, there’s continued focus on food security and ensuring that they have a robust agricultural industry to ensure the less reliance on outside places. So, for doing that, we expect that actually potash demand will increase internally, because the corn demand is so strong. But also, the other 1 is, their own internal production at Shanghai Lake is reaching its capacity and possibly even going down.

And let me start by saying, I suspect the market has been impacted by statements made by one of our competitors and their impairment of their phosphate business. So, let me be relatively direct with this. First of all, an impairment needs to be driven by a triggering event, at least that’s my standing of general accounting practices or IFRS. When I look at the potential triggering events, the one thing I can say is that phosphate prices are up significantly quarter-over-quarter. And if I look at the outside consultants that we use like CRU, their long-term estimates are also up. So, it is very difficult for me to see how long-term phosphate outlook was the triggering event for this write-down. So, as such, you asked me what I -- what we’re getting wrong. I think, people are taking the idea that the triggering event was the phosphate market, where clearly it had to be something different than that, and they’re assuming that means we have a poor outlook.', 'Now, what I will say is, if you compare the two businesses, we are very -- difficult to compare them one-to-one. First of all, we’re very different in scale, but we also sell very different products. They sell purified phosphoric acid, which is being highly impacted in the industrial sector by two things. One, the economy is slowing down; and the other, by external competition. Now if I look -- compare that to fertilizers, fertilizers is actually quite the opposite. We’ve seen an increase in demand, we’ve seen an increase in pricing, and we see a very good outlook. So, I don’t think you can compare the two businesses.

745,Joc O’Rourke,"['Yes. Thank you, Andrew. Look, you’re absolutely right. This is about trade flows, not overall supply and demand. So today, what the Russians and the Moroccans have done is they have redirected tons that would have otherwise come to the U.S. to either Brazil, India or in some cases, Eastern Canada. So, they have moved a number of tons to different markets. They have not sold significantly different number of tons globally than they have in any other year. So, we know that their overall supply and demand balance in the world has been very similar. So, where they pull tons out of the U.S., we’ve had to bring more tons into the U.S. to serve it, but you’re also seeing tons come from places that haven’t historically set tons to the U.S., like Australia and Mexico or significant tonnage in terms of that. So, you do see a difference in trade flows. So, what would happen if that reversed, my expectation is the reversal would create exactly the opposite. We would see more tons going from Mosaic to our Brazil business. We would see more tons going to India from our Saudi tonnage, et cetera, and there would be other imports coming into the U.S. So overall, we don’t think that this is going to make a huge difference. The big difference today is demand is up, Chinese exports are down, and we’re seeing a growing market and a good demand scenario around the world.']",question_answer,MOS_2960104

First of all, let me say, the weakening real, if it’s had a biggest impact, it has been on the profitability of the Brazilian farmer. So, that has really been what’s driving a great demand picture in Brazil. So, the Brazilian farmer is doing very well. If you look at it in terms of our business, what we would expect is our distribution business is relatively independent of the real pricing. And the reason for that is, we buy on U.S. dollars, we sell -- we then hedge that and convert to a Brazilian real number.', 'So, really, it doesn’t have a huge effect on our overall margins. What it does is it makes a difference to the actual demand. In terms of our production business though, obviously, on the shorter term, wages and everything else, Brazil real-based costs go down fairly quickly. So, we do see an improvement in cost and a better margin for our production business. What I will say, though, is if I look at the last couple of quarters, the Brazilian real has been essentially flat. If I look at our statistics for the last two quarters, we’re 5.37% versus this quarter of 5.38%. So, essentially, they’ve been perfectly flat. So, you can assume or surmise from that that the improvements we’re seeing is actual solid improvements in how we’re running the business as opposed to a benefit from an exchange rate.']",question_answer,MOS_2960104

One, on a longer-term basis, we would expect that effective tax rate to be somewhere in mid to high 20s.

And the first, I've already mentioned which is slower ramp-up of the projects particularly the ones in Russia and Belorussia. But what we would really expect is probably a higher utilization rate of the North American assets over the next say three to five years and a more modest rise in prices. That would suggest prices appreciate slightly to where they were maybe in 2018 and utilization of assets goes up at the same time.""]",question_answer,MOS_172710

888,Joc O’Rourke,"[""Thanks. Brazilian farm economics are really outstanding at present which is certainly helping to underpin pricing in that market and we expect that to continue. For the U.S. and Southeast Asian markets, I think it's important that remember that this is a seasonally slow period for potash demand and that will impact prices. I'd also like to highlight that our summer fill program was extremely well received. And it is typical of commodity markets to necessarily see first a rebound in demand and then prices following after that.

But as you say support payments from governments and whatnot have done a lot to keep farmer incomes at least stable. And yes, while we're pushing phosphate and potash prices -- probably not potash so much, but certainly phosphates a little bit closer to that ratio, two things on this I'd say is, first of all, you've got to look at December 2021 prices."", ""And if you look at December 2021 prices I think we -- I think, we'd be looking at what $3.60 for corn and $9 for bean.

I mean those are still yet to come but -- and maybe a little bit of extra coming out. I saw PhosAgro has been exporting or has been producing a little higher number. So there could be some new tonnes coming out of PhosAgro. But for the rest of the world I would say basically the closures are more than offsetting any small ramp-ups that we've seen.

902,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you for listening to our first quarter results discussion. Because we’re all working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic, we’re taking a different approach this quarter. We’ve made the script and all our earnings materials available at the same time and will record answers to questions you submit to Laura. As always, Laura and Lucy will be available to answer your questions.', 'I’ll start by expressing my hope that all of you and your families are safe and healthy. By now, the pandemic has touched and taken a great many lives, and we all know people who have been affected, whether by the virus directly or by its huge economic impact. Mosaic has been fortunate with COVID-19 having had minimal impact on our employees, operations or suppliers.', 'I will cover 3 topics today: First, the current strong conditions in the fertilizer market; second, COVID-19, its impact on our markets and agriculture now and going forward; and finally, our continued progress on our strategic initiatives.', 'Fertilizer markets are strong, and we continue to expect a good year. We expect growth in global shipments for both phosphates and potash this year. While our expectations have been modestly lower due to pressure on grain and oilseed prices, we expect good growth, in line with the steady growth in demand we’ve seen for decades. We are in the peak spring season in the Northern Hemisphere, and demand is running high. In fact, our retail customers are reporting that demand is outpacing even their high expectations.', 'Our April shipment volumes were robust, and prices are beginning to respond. While sentiment around biofuels and low grain and oilseed prices have dampened fertilizer price increases, Midwest DAP is up $36 per million tonne from the beginning of the year. Corn Belt MOP prices softened in the quarter as the market awaited a new China contract. But we’ve seen a significant change in sentiment with the signing of the China contract. Last week, Brazil’s CFR MLP price was up $20 per tonne following the contract announcement. The impact of COVID-19 in North America has pushed our customers to accelerate deliveries where possible. But otherwise, the season is playing out like a normal spring. Several factors have brought phosphate and potash markets into better balance.', 'First, while last fall’s North American application started late due to weather, it lasted longer than usual, which brought down fertilizer inventories. Second, inventories across the channel are low for the first time in a couple of years, and our tonnes on barges in the river are down by 80% compared with a year ago. We’re refilling warehouses quickly to meet very strong fast-paced spring demand in North America driven in part by high application rates to replenish nutrient-depleted soils. Third, phosphate supplies from our competitors has been impacted by COVID-19 and unrelated operational issues.', 'In fact, compared with last year, we believe phosphate production is down by over 500,000 tonnes, excluding changes in China. Fourth, demand in China remained strong during the spring season, and India continues to import record amounts of DAP. Much of India’s domestic production declines have been offset by finished product shipments into the country, but total global supply is down. While Chinese exports are down almost 500,000 tonnes compared with a year ago, we expect China to make up some of but not all of those tonnes in the second half of the year.', 'And finally, phosphate imports into North America are down year over year by approximately 250,000 tonnes through April. After the severe demand shock resulting from bad weather in spring of ‘19, importers seem to be finding homes for their tonnes elsewhere. Last week, the signing of a new potash contract with China helped form the base on which global prices can build, given strong demand. The published contract price of $220 per tonne is for red standard, and prices are higher for white and granular.', 'As is typical, we believe the granular price is $15 premium to current Brazil spot prices. We believe we will continue to see potash volume and price increases from here. Slide 5 in our presentation shows a strongly positive market reaction to the contract signing in 2016 in a similar pricing environment. Much of North American spring was planned and executed before the whole effect of COVID-19 occurred, and the pandemic is clearly impacting sentiment in every sector of the economy.', 'I’ll spend a few minutes providing insight into impacts on our markets and our best view of how the season ahead will play out broadly and for Mosaic. As you can see on Slide 6, we’ve highlighted not only the risks that we are actively monitoring but also opportunities that we expect and have seen. USDA planting expectations, currently at 97 million acres of corn and 84 million acres of soybeans this year, are likely to be revised as growers adjust to shifting markets and especially to ethanol production expectations. We believe that the reduction in biofuel demand may be up to the equivalent of 5 million acres of corn.', 'Some of the actual acres that would have grown corn will migrate to soybeans, and at Mosaic, we are agnostic. Corns and soybeans both require significant amounts of potash and phosphate. There is potential for much of the biofuels-related demand destruction in North America to be balanced by increased corn demand in China, as the nation continues to rebuild herds following the African swine fever outbreak last year. Elsewhere, we could see impacts to potash demand resulting from weak palm oil prices, which could take longer to rebound. As it relates to our business to date, we’ve seen very little direct impact of COVID-19 on our financial performance with the total combined margin impact of outages at Miski Mayo and Patrocinio under $10 million in the quarter. That said, we have seen more cautious sentiment from our buyers.', 'We are closely monitoring the very dynamic situation in our markets, as well as logistics and supply chain risks. Our goal is to be ahead of potential scenarios, to be flexible and to quickly adapt to any changes. This means maintaining a high degree of optionality in our logistics and sourcing and constant communication with our teams, suppliers and service providers. Some of the actions we are already taking include finding alternative sources for phosphate rock to protect against the Miski Mayo outage extending longer than currently expected, as well as finding new sources of sulfur and sulfuric acid to ensure we can continue to meet our production needs through this period of uncertainty.', 'It is important to note that we are finding opportunities as well. For example, we’re seeing more rail and truck availability as other industries’ demand has fallen, which increases our flexibility and capacity to move product to market and lowers our fuel and freight costs. Also, while the availability of sulfur around the world is being impacted by lower refining activity, we have taken advantage of opportunities to purchase inexpensive sulfuric acid shipments that were in transit to other buyers who no longer had a need for it. In addition, we are seeing reduced G&A expenses as we’ve curtailed travel, and we expect a more moderate level of spend longer term, as employees over the last couple of months have embraced various tools and technologies that promote face-to-face collaboration without having to travel. We’ve also seen positive developments in cash taxes.', 'Recent passed legislation will accelerate cash tax refund that we had anticipated collecting over the next few years. As a result, we have updated our cash tax expectations for the year to reflect a net inflow of approximately $15 million from refunds versus a net outflow previously. When it comes to our operations, we’ve been fortunate. Our supply chain partners continue to operate well, and we maintain the ability to move product by rail, truck, barge and ship. Our employees have been exceptional.', 'Only a handful of our employees have tested positive for the virus, and none has been critically ill. We responded to the pandemic by adapting quickly to keep our people healthy and safe. We managed shift schedules to keep people at safe distances from each other. We kept the office workers engaged while working from home, and we ensured that we were equipped with appropriate supplies of personal protective gear.', 'We fundamentally shifted how we worked in just a few days. We’re also doing our part to help society deal with the pandemic. We’ve invested over $1.5 million in the communities where we operate to help with those communities most urgent needs including medical supplies and food relief. Beyond COVID-19, Mosaic continues to execute well and responsibly so that we can maximize the benefit from improving markets.', 'Our plants and mines are operating efficiently and at high production rates, and our safety performance continues to improve. In Brazil, we’ve achieved transformational savings of $17 million in the quarter, and we are well on our way toward our new $50 million additional savings target for 2020. Our K3 project continues to gain momentum with the third miner placed into operation in March and the fourth miner due to be completed within the next month. Our newly combined North American business is identifying significant costs and other efficiency opportunities, and our SG&A expenses are down considerably primarily from lower long-term performance-based incentives.', 'Now I will turn the call over to Clint to discuss the quarter, how we think about our liquidity and financial strength and the scenarios we’ve considered. Clint?']",management_discussion,MOS_168301
903,Clint Freeland,"['Thank you, Joc. As we look back on the first quarter, there were a number of dynamics that we saw in the business, specifically around sales volumes, finished product prices and currencies. First, volumes in our three operating segments were up 14% compared to the first quarter of 2019 as an extended North American fall application season benefited potash and phosphate volumes, and market strength led to higher activity at Mosaic Fertilizantes. The combination of this strong demand and industry curtailments led to a rebound in phosphate spot prices during the quarter, and this dynamic has accelerated into the North American spring season. Recall, however, that there is a lag between market price changes and realizing those prices in our results. So we would expect to realize more of these market price improvements in the second quarter and beyond.', 'Global currency volatility also had an impact on our business and financial results. In Brazil, the real depreciated by 22% versus the dollar during the first quarter. And as we’ve discussed in the past, depreciation of the real is directionally a benefit to Mosaic and Brazilian farmers as it lowers our production costs in dollar terms and improves farmer margins. With that said, we are mindful that this may create credit risk for certain customers with U.S. dollar obligations. However, we have seen minimal impact from this to date.', 'While the currency volatility has been less than Brazil, the same dynamics apply to our business in Canada, where the Canadian dollar depreciated by 8% during the quarter. Recall, however, that we have a rolling currency hedging program that smooths out short-term volatility. So the effect of the currency movements on our financial results will be somewhat delayed.', 'As a result of these currency movements, we recorded $295 million of unrealized foreign currency losses during the quarter. Of this amount, $239 million is related to accounting for U.S. dollar-denominated liabilities including intercompany balances at our foreign subsidiaries. When those liabilities are converted from U.S. dollars to local currency as part of the normal accounting process, that impact is reflected on the income statement. However, when the subsidiary balance sheets are subsequently translated back into U.S. dollars as part of the normal consolidation process, there’s an identical and offsetting adjustment to the balance sheet in the other comprehensive income account. The remaining $56 million is the unrealized mark-to-market on our normal course hedging program. We treat all of this as notable in calculating our adjusted earnings and adjusted EBITDA. I would also note that approximately $30 million in realized gains that relate to balance sheet hedges have been treated as notable items as the benefit of these hedges had no corresponding offset on the income statement.', 'As outlined on Slide 10, Mosaic’s reported net loss for the first quarter of 2020 totaled $203 million or $0.54 per share, which included $295 million in noncash foreign currency losses that I just mentioned and normal FX hedging, particularly in Brazil. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $214 million and adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.06.', 'At our potash business, adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter was $175 million, down from $256 million in the first quarter of 2019. Sales volumes during the period were up 2% compared to the previous year, as improving North American sales were mostly offset by lower international sales due to the lack of the China contract.', 'Adjusted gross margin per tonne totaled $69 during the quarter compared to $100 per tonne last year as the reduction in average sales price more than offset the improvement in cash cost of production. It is notable that during the first quarter, cash cost of production were $70 per tonne, including $11 per tonne of cash brine management cost. This brings our cash cost of production, excluding brine cost, to $59 per tonne, which is below our 2021 target of $62 per tonne, while operating at a reasonable and sustainable 85% operating rate. While depreciation of the Canadian dollar contributed $1 per tonne to the benefit, most of the cost improvement has resulted from active portfolio management and the success of the K3 project. In the phosphates business, first-quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $8 million, compared to $168 million in the first quarter of 2019. Finished product sales volumes were up 7% year over year, reflecting the surge in late-fall applications in January and a strong start to the spring season.', 'However, these higher sales and lower sulfur costs were more than offset by weaker average sales prices. With that said, we have seen average realized at-the-plant DAP prices strengthened by $8 per tonne in the first quarter and would expect that to accelerate into the second quarter as more recent pricing trends are realized into results. While some of this improvement is masked in results by the normal shift away from higher-margin MicroEssentials sales in the first quarter, we expect this to correct itself in the second quarter as strong MicroEssentials sales into North America are occurring. We continue to make significant progress on costs.', 'For instance, our cash rock cost reached $36 per tonne, with our Florida mining operations delivering one of the best quarters in years and below our 2021 target of $39 per tonne. While our cash conversion costs rose to $67 per tonne due to the impact of curtailments, we should return to more normal levels in the second quarter as those facilities are back up to full operation. And finally, we’ve seen substantial benefits in our raw material costs, primarily sulfur. While sulfur prices have increased recently to $54 per tonne under our second-quarter contracts, they are still well below average 2019 levels.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes had a strong first quarter in terms of volumes, gross margin and adjusted EBITDA, with adjusted EBITDA totaling $68 million, compared to $62 million in the first quarter of 2019 despite the year-over-year finished product pricing trends, reflecting the impact of the company’s synergy and transformation programs. Similar to the phosphate operation, cash rock cost at Mosaic Fertilizantes improved meaningfully to BRL 312 per tonne, down 9% compared to the fourth quarter of 2019 and below our 2021 target of BRL 320. In dollar terms, with the weakness in the local currency, cash rock costs were down 16% over the same period to $70 per tonne. Cash cost of phosphate conversion were up 7% in real from the fourth quarter due to a shift in production from TSP to higher-cost, higher-margin MAP.', 'However, reported cost in dollar terms were down 8% over the same period after factoring local currency weakness. We’ve shown Slide 11 before, and we’re making progress toward achieving the $225 million in incremental EBITDA this year. In the first quarter, Plant City closure costs were $10 million less. Potash production cost, excluding currency benefits, delivered $35 million versus the $70 million to $80 million target.', 'And Brazil transformation efforts realized $17 million of the $50 million total. For the $80 million benefit, we expect to see related to dam remediation in Brazil. Recall that those costs did not become material last year until the second quarter. So we would expect to see those benefits throughout the balance of this year.', 'As reflected on Slide 12, consolidated liquidity totaled $2.7 billion at March 31. As previously announced, we believe the current environment makes holding more cash than normal prudent. So during the quarter, we accessed both our committed revolver and uncommitted working capital facilities to raise the amount of cash on the balance sheet. At the end of the quarter, unrestricted cash stood at $1.1 billion with an additional $1.6 billion available under Mosaic’s committed revolver and $50 million to $100 million available under uncommitted working capital facilities depending on the available borrowing base.', 'The company’s liquidity position improved further in the month of April as cash balances continue to build. Cash from operations during the first quarter was positive $190 million, a $366 million improvement over last year as a result of continued management of both cost and working capital. As is normal for Mosaic, net debt rose during the quarter by $415 million, less than last year. I would also note that during the quarter, our structured payables balance in Brazil, which is not part of net debt, declined by $241 million. As we look to the balance of the year, we are expecting up to $170 million in additional cash inflow from both domestic and international tax refunds in excess of our previous estimates and the unwinding of an interest rate swap.', 'In fact, we’ve already received over half of this amount in the second quarter. As we look to manage our liquidity, we view these kind of cash enhancing steps as constructive and preferable to other options such as cutting CapEx as it allows the company to remain on target with value-enhancing projects such as K3 and the Brazil transformation. With that said, we do retain the ability to adjust our spend profile, should circumstances warrant. As we move forward in the year, we intend to maintain an elevated cash position.', 'However, should uncertainty around COVID-19 diminish, we would expect to return some, if not all, of the cash accessed under our lines and return to a more normal liquidity profile. With that, I’ll turn the call back over to you, Joc.']",management_discussion,MOS_168301

914,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Chris. Yes. We’re definitely enjoying lower transportation costs right now, which is providing a bit of a tailwind. Of course, the cost of fuel is helping us from a rail and ocean freight perspective. And on rail, there’s an extra efficiency in that we’re not transporting as much of other products, so it adds a lot more availability to us. In terms of ocean freight, while ocean freight is helping us, it’s also helping the whole industry. And so the bigger impact there is it will probably trade, change the trade flows rather than make a real difference to our competitiveness.']",question_answer,MOS_168301
915,Laura Gagnon,['This next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard at Bernstein. Can you talk about the drivers of differences between rock costs per tonne in Florida versus Brazil? What is the long-term goal for Brazilian rock costs? And what is the rock costs per tonne in Peru?'],question_answer,MOS_168301
916,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Jonas, for the question. In terms of our rock mining costs, we have a very different mining method in Florida versus Brazil. And the main reason for that is, in Florida, we have a sedimentary deposit where we’re able to use large draglines to move the rock. In Brazil, it’s an igneous deposit, and we have to blast and use truck and shovel to move the ore in that situation. So Brazil will always have a slightly higher cost per tonne than the U.S. will have, but the advantage, of course, is you don’t have freight from the coast up to our growing regions or up to Uberaba which where we will use the rock. So in location, it’s very competitive.', 'Long term, we’ve put out our goals as having rock costs in the range of BRL 300 per tonne. We still see that as being a good goal, and we believe we’ll achieve that goal. Matter of fact, I think we’ve achieved that goal this year. So we’re doing well on rock costs. We expect to continuously improve, and that’s really a good thing.', 'In terms of Peru, again, it’s a truck and shovel operation, but it is a sedimentary rock, so we don’t have to blast. So they have pretty good costs. They’re somewhere in between our Florida costs and our Brazilian costs.']",question_answer,MOS_168301

As we look at 2020 and K3, by the end of the year, we expect we’ll be running in that 2.5 million to 3 million tonnes per year of actual potash produced coming out of K3. As I said earlier, that will allow us to virtually eliminate the K1 mine and have all the K1 plant be fed by the K3 mine. In terms of this year, we expect to exceed the 1 million tonnes that we’ve previously announced, and we should produce somewhere between 1 million and 1.5 million tonnes of actual production from the K3 mine.

We had a late fall, but it continued well into the late, late fall and into the winter months, and so the revenue recognition in Q1 was impacted by funds that would have normally moved earlier in the year in Q4.', 'In terms of moving tonnes from Q1 from Q2, I think that effect will be minimal.

It allows us an avenue to distribute our value-added products like MicroEssentials and continue to grow that market.

928,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, guys. Certainly, the oil industry disruption is having a knock-on effect in terms of sulfur. At Mosaic, there’s 2 things we’re doing to really help our sulfur situation. One, as you suggested, we are moving to a higher level of inventory to make sure we have a better buffer. And then secondly, we’ve actually been sourcing cheap or cheap-ish sulfuric acid to supplement our supply. Now that has worked out quite well because other industries have slowed down. But in terms of the overall world sulfur market, one of the things I will say is Mosaic is probably better positioned than most because of our position in U.S. Gulf. And remember, in the U.S. Gulf, while the production is down, they’re using more heavy crude right now, which produces more sulfur. Certainly, there is going to be periodic and localized sulfur deficiencies around the globe. But I think in that, Mosaic will be positioned best to weather the storm.']",question_answer,MOS_168301

And in years where crop prices get difficult, we see that people focus on maximizing the return, and we’ve seen good growth in MicroEssentials.

936,Joc O’Rourke,"['Well, thank you, guys. Let me answer those one at a time. Certainly, our next-gen mining and next-gen processing will improve both our recovery rates and our costs in the phosphate business. Also, we’re doing other things like considering the integration of our Phosphates and Potash business, which takes significant costs out of those businesses. So it’s not just the technology. It’s all the other day-to-day stuff that goes with it.', 'In terms of phosphate production reductions, we’ve always said we will match the needs of our customers with our production. At this stage, we believe that we are matching that effectively, and there will be no need for production reductions. And we believe that the demand is there today, so prices should follow in time.', 'In terms of our overall costs, these have been pretty much constant in Phosphates for up to 10 years.

939,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, I’m going to move on to the market-related questions. Many of them were multi-parts, and I’ve done my best to summarize those. The first question comes from Ben Isaacson at Scotia, Seth Goldstein at Morningside (sic) [Morningstar] and Rikin Patel at Bernberg. They’ve all asked about new Chinese contract pricing, including when do you think the seaborne trade to China will pick up again given the amount of potash and bonded warehouses? How did the price compare to your expectations? And how frequently do you expect these contracts to reset, in another 12 months or 18 months? And what is the outlook for volumes contracted to China and India?']",question_answer,MOS_168301
940,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, guys. Let me take these one at a time. First of all, we expect that the actual shipments to China will start almost immediately. Yes, there is material in bonded warehouses, but our expectation is that will go and start filling up the NPK plants and the retailers very quickly. And what will come behind will be the retail for the fall.', 'How does the price compare to our expectations in that, certainly, we’re disappointed in a price as low as came in. But I will emphasize, China is still an important base contract, and the thing there is to get the volumes moving. We’ve already seen the ability to move prices up in Brazil since we got that contract settled. So the big thing there is really, get it done, move forward and work on moving prices up in the rest of the world.', 'The third piece, in terms of volume for China and India, we do expect imports to China will be down slightly to, I think, around 8 million tonnes. And in terms of India, they’ll be up maybe 0.5 million tonnes to 4.5 million tonnes.

941,Laura Gagnon,"['Joc, the next question comes from Vincent Andrews at Morgan Stanley, specifically addressing Slide 5. Slide 5 argues that the 2020 Chinese potash contract could set off a similar potash price run as the settlement did in 2016. What are the similarities and differences to S&D, U.S. dollar and soft commodity prices that both support and refute such a comparison. And in particular, given the substantial volume sitting in Chinese bonded warehouses today, will the potash market really be able to have a near-term price upswing if the industry is not actually shipping material incremental potash to China in the next quarter or so?']",question_answer,MOS_168301

943,Richard McLellan,"['Yes. Thanks, Joc. And Vincent, it really is amazing how much this year lines up to what we observed coming out of 2016 and the settlement from China. The industry sentiment at the time after entering through a period of prolonged oversupply, it was -- the expectation was for the prices to remain soft. But the fact that the China volume occurred and the contract occurred almost immediately, we saw the market kind of step up.', 'And I think one of the questions that you need to ask yourself are what are the similarities that are happening today that are -- that happened at the last time. Generally speaking, the dollar is not much different than it was three to four years ago with the exception of Brazil, which, frankly, is positive for commodities. Ag commodity prices, for the most part, were weaker today than they were in ‘16 and ‘17. But if you remember, we also saw corn futures bouncing around the low $3 range then as well. And the other current uncertainty is the COVID-19. But we think, overall, this is a very good analogy to look at and to understand.

944,Laura Gagnon,"['Chris Parkinson at Crédit Suisse and PJ Juvekar from Citi both have questions on the potash cost curve. So Joc, can you discuss your views of the global potash cost curve?

947,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Mark. The question about why we would put product into bonded warehouses when there isn’t a contract, it’s a delicate balance between continuing to keep production going, product flowing. If there’s an anticipation of a contract in the near term, I think it certainly makes some sense to advance some product to those markets.

948,Laura Gagnon,"['The following question comes from Adam Samuelson at Goldman Sachs, asking more broadly about the potash market. Mosaic lowered its global product shipment forecast by 2 million tonnes relative to its February forecast versus a downwardly revised 2019 level. Given that at least 1.5 million tonnes of fourth quarter 2019 production curtailment and 1.5 million tonnes of new capacity coming onstream in 2020, do you expect similar production curtailments in the second half of 2020 as we saw in the second half of 2019?

949,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Adam. Yes, there’s no question the production will be down from what it was previously, and we’ve seen reduced operating rates carried through from last year into 2020, for example, Nutrien’s Vanscoy facility is down. And you’re aware, earlier this year, we decided that we would keep Colonsay down indefinitely. So that, coupled with a few, albeit small, production cuts due to COVID-19 issues around the world, we don’t see a market being particularly burdened by supply. This is also supported by our view that there will only be about 1 million tonnes of incremental production coming on this year between SQM, K+S and EuroChem and with the commissioning of the Petrikovsky mine in Belarus. As for Mosaic’s production, we continue to maintain that we will match our production with our customers’ requirements.

So we think our estimates are pretty realistic.', 'In terms of African swine fever, there have been reports of some small-scale African swine fever outbreaks over the last weeks. But thus far, it appears to be just that, small and isolated. And bear in mind that many were expecting the demise of the Chinese soybean imports last year during the height of the outbreak. And China actually imported slightly more soybeans last year than they did in ‘18. So likely, they sought to maximize output across all their livestock classes.', 'With that, we will wrap up this Q&A session. I hope you take away a few key points.

973,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. As you're well aware, 2019 was a challenging year in our industry and for Mosaic, as poor weather in North America for three consecutive fertilizer application seasons left finished product inventories high and prices low, especially phosphates. Our realized DAP price declined 20% in 2019 and while potash prices remained relatively stable for most of the year, sales volumes were off over 10% as market demand weakened. Despite these market dynamics, we at Mosaic continued to focus on execution within our business and actively managing our portfolio of assets to effectively navigate this period of short-term weakness and position Mosaic for long-term success."", 'Now with constructive agricultural commodity prices and nutrient depleted soils across most of the U.S. corn belt growers have strong incentive to plant maximum acres and maximize their yields. We expect that U.S. farmers will plant 10 million to 15 million more acres than last year and we expect very strong fertilizer consumption and demand this spring in North America. And we are not alone.', 'A few weeks ago, we held our biggest customer event and it gave our entire executive team three days to engage with our top global customers. The atmosphere was upbeat. Ag retailers are feeling much better as we head into 2020. This sentiment shift, producer curtailments and a late fall surge of applications has driven phosphate prices higher. Today, we are seeing more than $65 per tonne improvement from the lowest prices traded we made in December.', ""Add to that, the extended production downtime in China due to the coronavirus and we see a much more constructive global supply and demand picture for the global phosphate market. This demand has depleted our inventories and will lead us to bring phosphate production back to full levels before the end of the first quarter. The potash market is waiting for a China contract to form a new price benchmark and the country's necessary response to the coronavirus outbreak has made the timing of that settlement more uncertain."", 'We do expect good demand in North America, Brazil and Southeast Asia, as farm economics are driving strong demand for potash around the world. So we may see a divergence from the China contract as the benchmark. We will continue to monitor the dynamics in China as they develop. While we cannot control weather or viruses and how the market reacts to those types of events, our focus continues to be on running our operations well and advancing our strategic initiatives.', 'In 2019, we made significant progress in managing and transforming each of our business units. In potash, we demonstrated that we could exceed major development milestones allowing us to accelerate the development of our K3 mine at Esterhazy, Saskatchewan. We increased the pace of capital allocated to this mega project to match the execution pace, so that we could eliminate brine management costs at K1 and K2, a full 2.5 years earlier than originally planned. These cost savings combined with lower cost of production should result in a total cash savings of approximately $300 million.', ""The ramp-up of K3 production facilitated the extended idling of the Colonsay mine. We expect to be able to meet market demand with our currently operating potash facilities and we've retained substantial surge capacity if the pace of demand growth accelerates."", ""Our Mosaic Fertilizantes business in South America has made tremendous strides since we completed the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition two years ago. We've now achieved approximately $330 million in annual net synergies well above our original target and we've committed to achieve an additional $200 million in annual EBITDA benefit by the end of 2022."", 'We also responded to the difficult situation of changing tailings down regulations with an aggressive and transparent approach. While meeting the new standards resulted in $80 million in cost and significant downtime at three of our Brazilian facilities in 2019, we were able to reach a successful resolution with all operating down certified by third parties and return to full production.', 'In phosphates, we demonstrated market and cost discipline. First by permanently closing the Plant City facility and then through curtailments at other phosphate manufacturing plants as markets weakened. The reduction in supply is now beginning to bring the global supply and demand picture into balance.', 'We are also executing a number of very exciting and promising initiatives to drive significant future efficiency gains. Those of you who joined us for our Analyst Day last March may recall that we discussed potential technological improvements at our mines. That potential is beginning to come to fruition and we are moving towards automating many elements of our mining processes in both phosphates and potash.', 'We expect the relative modest capital requirements to yield strong ROI in the near future and enable safe and reliable production for many years to come. We pushed the organization on many fronts in 2019 and we accomplished a great deal while affirming our commitments to responsible operations. In fact, we generated record safety performance for the seventh consecutive year and our recordable injury frequency rate is industry-leading.', 'We believe the broad spectrum of ESG performance provides good measures of risk management and management effectiveness and we are delivering strong results. Taken together, the moves we made in 2019 has strengthened Mosaic, permanently reduced our costs and help balance global potash and phosphate supply and demand.', ""Now I will turn the call over to Clint to discuss the financial details and changes in our approach to setting forward-looking expectations.

974,Clint Freeland,"[""Thank you, Joc, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 5, Mosaic's reported net loss for the fourth quarter of 2019 totaled $921 million or $2.43 per share, which included $1.1 billion in previously announced non-cash charges related to asset and goodwill write-offs. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $202 million and adjusted EPS was a loss of $0.29."", ""For the full year, Mosaic's net loss totaled $1.1 billion including approximately $1.5 billion in non-cash charges related to the Plant City closure and the impairment of goodwill at the phosphates business unit. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.35 billion and adjusted earnings per share were $0.16."", 'At our potash business, adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $159 million, down from $270 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to lower sales volumes and a higher rate of fixed cost absorption as we adjusted production levels to more closely align with customer demand.', 'With reduced demand during the fall application season, we curtailed production at our Colonsay facility leading to an overall operating rate for the segment of 63%, down from 99% in the fourth quarter of 2018. While this would normally lead to a sequential increase in production cost per tonne given the fixed cost intensity of that business, cash cost of production during the fourth quarter actually declined compared to the third quarter of 2019 as the company began to realize the benefits associated with shifting production from Colonsay to the lower cost Esterhazy K3 facility.', 'Additionally, gross margins benefited from a true-up of Canadian resource taxes of $13.8 million or $9 a tonne from extending the Colonsay idling. At the phosphates business, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $8 million compared to $240 million in the fourth quarter of 2018, a significantly lower finished goods prices more than offset an improvement in raw material costs.', 'Despite market headwinds, which continued through the quarter, the company continued to focus on managing cost and for the period recorded a sequential decline in cash conversion cost to $64 per tonne and a $2 per tonne reduction in cash rock costs.', 'Adjusted EBITDA at Mosaic Fertilizantes totaled $78 million during the fourth quarter compared to $138 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 as lower finished goods prices, distribution margin pressure and higher idle costs, more than offset benefits from raw material costs and foreign exchange rates as well as transformational gains.', ""As noted on the slide though, the segment's operating rate improved reflecting the final resolution of the tailings dam remediation and helping to drive cash conversion cost back to levels we saw before operations were slowed by the mine closures."", ""At this point, I'd like to turn to 2020 expectations. And as you may recall, I noted on our third quarter conference call that we were considering changes to our approach on earnings guidance."", ""The reason for this is that the primary driver behind Mosaic's earnings is the market price of finished phosphate and potash products, which is something we don't control and which can change quickly and meaningfully both positively as they did in 2018 or negatively as they did in 2019."", ""Additionally, we're mindful that any direct or implied pricing outlook we provide can and likely will influence customer behavior. As such, we're modifying our approach to give investors the information and tools we believe they need to accurately model the company and to make reasonable adjustments throughout the year as markets change."", 'As shown on slide 7, our approach pivots of actual reported adjusted EBITDA results, $1.35 billion for full year 2019 in this case. We will also note those non-market related items that will be different going forward.', ""In this case the $225 million that we've previously disclosed related to cost incurred in 2019 that will not reoccur in 2020 or known structural benefits from actions taken by the company."", ""Further detail on the makeup of that $225 million can be found in the appendix of this presentation. The total of these two items $1.575 billion in this case, should be the starting point for an investor's 2020 analysis."", ""As you can see we've provided annualized adjusted EBITDA sensitivities for both realized FOB mine fertilizer prices and foreign currencies, which can be applied by investors to adjust their estimates for full year consolidated results. Going forward, I would not expect to update these numbers unless there is a material change to the non market-related items."", ""For full year volumes, we've provided a summary of the history of each segment on slide 8. Like prices, volumes are driven by market conditions. So, consistent with our approach on market prices, we will not be providing forward guidance on volumes. But this is an important assumption that investors should update in their evaluation of the company."", 'One thing to note for 2020 is that we do not expect the previously disclosed curtailments in the phosphate and potash businesses to limit sales volumes in 2020 as the ramp-up of K3 replaces lost production from Colonsay and Bartow has already begun to restart production.', ""As reflected on slide 9, we will continue to provide the company's outlook for capital expenditures and those items needed to help investors reconcile from adjusted EBITDA to EPS."", ""This is the same information we've provided in the past including our expectations for DD&A, net interest expense, non notable adjustments like equity compensation and ARO accretion, and an estimated effective tax rate."", ""As you will note Mosaic's sustaining CapEx level for 2020 is somewhat elevated compared to historic norms, primarily due to approximately $75 million in record spend related to the phosphate segments consent decree. All work under that agreement must be final this year, so this will not be a recurring cost moving forward."", 'Growth CapEx for the year is focused on the K3 project at Esterhazy, and represents approximately $300 million of this total. Most of the balance is associated with previously disclosed phosphate mine extension efforts in Florida and investments in Brazil related to the next-generation transformation work at Mosaic Fertilizantes, which is expected to generate $200 million per year in recurring EBITDA benefits by the end of 2022.', 'And finally, to assist investors in refining their modeling of the company, we will be supplementing our traditional disclosures with two new sets of data. First, we will add new disclosures to our quarterly performance data on a number of topics. Most importantly, detail around realized pricing, product and geographic mix and raw material mix and realized costs.', ""Second, while our updated outlook approach is focused on annual results, we recognize the importance of modeling quarterly earnings so to that end, we will begin disclosing monthly sales volumes and revenues by business unit for the first two months of each quarter. This information will be provided in the middle of the following month on Mosaic's investor website with results for the third month of each quarter provided in the regular quarterly earnings release."", 'We believe this will enable investors to more effectively model quarterly results and better understand both the seasonality of our business and the lag that typically occurs between visible changes in benchmark prices and actual product pricing realized by the company.', ""And finally, to assist investors with more detailed modeling of Mosaic, particularly those who have less history with the company, we'll be providing an investor education deck on our investor website that will provide additional detail on the most important factors and dynamics that should be included in an analysis of the company."", ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Rick to share insight on the coronavirus.""]",management_discussion,MOS_164419

On behalf of all Mosaic employees, I'd like to say our thoughts continue to be with our China employees and the people in China as they manage not only the direct impacts of the coronavirus, but also the challenges they are facing with restricted movements, supply shortages and the uncertainty of when normal daily operations will resume."", ""Since keeping farmers healthy is critical to protecting China's food supply, we are in the process of procuring face mask to distribute to rural farmers through our local operations and business partners. These small efforts are greatly needed in the region and we hope this assists in stemming the spread of the virus."", ""Beyond the imminent humanitarian issues, we know there will be impact in China's supply and demand for both phosphates and potash. Approximately 30% of Chinese phosphate rock, 30% of China's DAP, and 45% of China's MAP are produced in Hubei province, which is the epicenter of this outbreak and has been subject to the most restricted rules enacted to reduce the spread of the virus."", 'In Hubei, phosphate production facilities have been on extended shutdowns and we understand the second round of shutdowns has been enacted from February 16 through the 29th. We believe the earliest these plants could reopen would be sometime in the first week of March.', 'Plants that had already resumed operations outside of Hubei province are now running short of raw materials causing some of them to reduce production. We believe the overall phosphate production shortfall will ultimately be two million tonnes in the first half of 2020.', 'Based upon surveys our China team conducted, half of the NPK and blend plant operators surveyed stated they have about two weeks of raw material on hand once they return to operations. This is a very low level.', 'If phosphate prices are attractive we do expect China to be able to ramp up to recover a portion in the back half of 2020. For potash transportation issues have hampered movement of product away from the ports and will impact ongoing contract discussions. However, spring is near and the government is working proactively to ensure the return of logistics support for agricultural products. When workers are able to safely return to duty in the plants and in transportation, the resumption of normal operations is expected to be slow. But once trucks return to the road, we expect potash will move from the port to the blenders and on to farmers, creating a need for additional potash imports during the second quarter. We continue to monitor the situation and how best we can position Mosaic in these markets and expect to provide an update later in March.', ""I'll now turn the call back over to Joc to share our updated strategic priorities.""]",management_discussion,MOS_164419

We have a clear strategic road map to grow and strengthen the company and we have the right teams in place to execute the strategy. Our goals have not changed to drive increased efficiency and competitiveness in our existing business and grow value for the long-term.', ""The enterprise is aligned around six strategic priorities that will build on our current strong foundation and drive a step change in performance. First in North America we'll continue to transform our potash and phosphate businesses and pursue new opportunities to improve their profitability and competitiveness. Technology and innovation will be used to accelerate our progress and drive value beyond the transformative efforts currently underway such as Esterhazy K3 and next-generation mining in phosphates."", 'Second, we plan to fully leverage our manufacturing and distribution advantage in Brazil, which is the fastest-growing agricultural market in the world to increase market share and profitability.', 'Third, we will continue to grow and strengthen the value of our product portfolio by building on the success of performance products and by pursuing strategic opportunities within the broader soil health space.', 'Fourth, we will leverage the learnings from our very successful Brazil integration to drive improved collaboration and efficiency in our corporate functions as well.', 'Fifth is our approach to capital and asset optimization.

I think the weather conditions, as we've kind of talked about, drove pricing to where it was and excess of imports coming to the U.S. Gulf compared to what the demand was at the farm level, that displacement of time really put the pressure on pricing at the Gulf."", ""And so, as you look for demand increases for 2020, as we've got in the model for North America, I think one of the things you have to take a look at is the ratio of P&K to the commodity prices. If farmers follow money and where phosphate and potash prices are today, will certainly lend itself to increased farmer applications, on a per acre basis. And that's the only other point, I'd add to what you said, Joc.""]",question_answer,MOS_164419

1004,Rick McLellan,"[""Yeah. I think, the timing Don, you hit a couple of key points.

And in fact, indexing into a market that's strengthening like, we're seeing today probably works to -- works more to the producer advantage than it does to the buyer."", ""And so from that perspective, and so that you talked about pricing, we believe that as we move forward into the second quarter, that you're looking at least center of gulf for noble pricing, in the $300 a tonne range with some opportunities to move from there. And we're looking for the Brazil price. Right now we've sold some 315s into Brazil for MAP or 335 what I should say. And we're looking for the 340s and there are opportunities to move from there.

And when you actually see it, show up in our financial statements."", ""And then one other thing that may assist people, on this front, just to monitor that lag and to see things as they realize are some of our monthly disclosures that we've talked about putting out going forward, around not only volumes, but also realize revenues on a monthly basis.

And then I'll circle back and finish up the presentation."", ""So for those of you that may not be all that familiar with Mosaic, Mosaic is one of the largest integrated potash and phosphate fertilizer manufacturers in the world and primarily focused in the Americas. When you look at our underlying asset base and the core assets of the company, you can find them in United States, Canada and Brazil. We do have interest in joint ventures and other assets in other locations, but that's really the core of the company."", 'And as you can see from the shipments and where we send products, again, the vast majority of what we sell goes into the Americas, although we do have a pretty meaningful presence in Asia and Australia. The products that we make, most of them, the vast majority of what we make are commodity products such as DAP, MAP, MOP, potash. But we also make specialized and premium fertilizers, things like MicroEssentials, Aspire, K-Mag and so forth and, in fact, have a pretty substantial market penetration of the top premium fertilizer manufacturers in the world.', ""Not only do we manufacture fertilizer, but we also have distribution businesses in three of the largest markets in the world, namely Brazil, China and India. So in – particularly in Brazil, the marriage of production with distribution has been very beneficial for the company. So that's who we are and what we do. And I think as investors think about Mosaic, I think there are a number of things to think about, both long term and short term. And long-term demand for our product is pretty visible and fairly easy to understand."", ""As the world population grows, as incomes grow, the demand for food grows, the demand for higher-quality food grows. And our fertilizer and our products are a key input into being able to deliver the food that the world needs. Now the demand side is, you can see it over the last decade for both potash and phosphates, average demand globally for each of those has grown at least a million tonnes a year. Obviously, there's puts and takes each year. But on average, over the last decade, you've seen that type of growth, and we would expect that growth to continue."", ""Now in order to supply that market, one of the key things is to have an asset base that's long-lived, high quality, low cost and in good location because in this industry, logistics matters. And so again, as you look at the marriage of where our product is sold, mostly in the Americas, where our core assets are sold, mostly in the Americas, well-positioned assets and, certainly, high-quality, long-lived assets at that."", ""Now just having good assets isn't enough. You have to execute well. And you also have to continuously look for ways to improve your position on the cost curve, get more and more out of your assets. And so at Mosaic, we have kind of a continuous improvement element of our culture where we can't just sit on our laurels and milk the assets that we have. We need to continuously press to be better, more efficient, more streamlined and higher quality in what we deliver."", ""And we'll get into a couple of the initiatives here in a moment around some of the things that I would just note for you this morning in different parts of our business. And that certainly is what prepares you for the long term, but it also prepares you for the short term because this is a cyclical industry, and we've seen that in 2019. As we roll forward, there are a number of things that we see materializing that should make for a much better 2020."", ""And by positioning yourselves well and managing your company well and executing well, it not only allows you to navigate the more challenging periods of time like we've seen this year but also positions you well when markets recover. So there are a couple of things that I'll point to this morning on initiatives that we have been executing really well on that fundamentally, will transform our company over the next handful of years."", ""And I'll start with our Esterhazy K3 facility. I'm sure, as most of you know, we have – at our Esterhazy facility, we have two existing mines, K1 and K2 that we’ve been working over the past number of years on a new K3 project that ultimately, will replace K1 and K2. Now this migration from the two existing facilities to K3 is very significant and transformative for our entire Potash business, really, for a couple of reasons."", ""First, K3, we believe, will be one of the most efficient mines in the world, highly automated. When we look at cost per tonne that we believe that we can ultimately achieve out of K3 once it's fully ramped up and in full production, we think it will be pushing $50 a tonne, which is world-class and certainly one of the most efficient mines in the world."", ""The other thing is that for the last 30-years at K1 and K2, we've had to manage brine inflow in – I think it was 1985. We started having brine inflows. And during that period, we had to spend a significant amount of money to manage that. A number of years ago, that reached about $250 million per year. This year, it will be about $140 million, about $100 million in cash and $40 million in depreciation."", ""As we migrate over to K3 and ramp K1 and K2 down, those expenditures will go to zero. And then finally, the other element to this is not just lower cost per tonne, more efficiency and not just getting rid of brine costs, but also out of K3, we'll end up generating about another million tonnes of product relative to the combined total of K1 and K2."", ""So as you can see, it's a very significant project on its own that we're very excited about. Now originally, our original schedule was to have this project delivered in 2024. And for those that monitor global potash projects around the world, you know that a lot of these projects are having problems. They're being delayed, if not flooded. I would say that K3 is probably the only one of its kind in the world that's on time and on budget."", ""And in fact, it's a little bit better than that in that over the last 12 months, because of some of the things that we've done at K3, we've actually been able to accelerate the go-live and full operation of K3. We've accelerated that project by a total of two years. And when you look at the impact that, that has just on improved scheduling and execution, it's about $225 million in brine spend that we thought we were going to spend that we won't need to. Also, migrating to a more cost-effective production facility faster will save us about another $75 million."", ""So just the acceleration alone means about $300 million in benefit to the company. So again, I think this is a transformative project that's being executed very well, will fundamentally change our Potash business for the better, and we expect to see very significant benefits in the years to come."", ""The other transformation that I'd point out to you this morning where, again, I think we've been executing very well is down in Brazil. The beginning of 2018, we bought Vale's fertilizer production business in Brazil, and we married that with our existing distribution business. And as you can imagine, when you marry production with distribution, there's just a lot of benefits and synergies associated with that. And when we closed that acquisition, we announced that we were targeting $275 million in annual recurring synergies realized in the P&L within three years."", ""We expect and we'll hit that target this year, which is one year early, and we'll hit at least $275 million. And depending on – because a lot of these synergies actually come through cost of goods sold, and that depends on how much you sell, we think we may exceed that target by potentially upwards of $50 million this year."", ""Now one of the things that we've also seen is as we've been managing this business, as we've been finding opportunities, the ideas keep coming from – particularly from the sites themselves. And so what we've done now is we will finish our synergy program this year, but in a spirit of continuous improvement, we've announced the next generation of business improvement down in Brazil where over the next three year period, we believe that there's another $200 million in EBITDA benefit to be gained out of that business."", ""Now you shouldn't just think of that as reduced costs, right? Some of this is revenue. Some of this is higher production, more efficient production. Some of it's related to automation. Some of it's related to monetizing and selling byproducts that historically have simply been either stored or disposed of. There are all kinds of initiatives that are being generated out of this. But between those two programs, the synergy program and the business improvement program, through good execution of our team down there, there's roughly $500 million of EBITDA benefit coming out of that business."", ""And as you can see, the size, scale and growth of that business is significant and is beginning – over time, could approach the size, scale and importance of our existing two businesses of potash and phosphates. Now that's kind of how we're setting ourselves up for the long term and some of the transformation initiatives that are happening within the business, again, for the long term. But this time of the year, you typically get questions on shorter-term time horizon and what's going to be different in 2020 versus 2019."", ""And obviously, I'm not going to try to predict what prices are going to be. So what we've tried to do is to look at the company regardless of what happens with prices. And there are four things in particular that will happen in 2020 relative to 2019 that provide about $225 million worth of EBITDA benefit. In 2019, we spent about $80 million down in Brazil, managing the business through some of the dam remediation initiatives that we went through earlier this year."", ""The last of those dollars will come through cost of goods sold in the fourth quarter and then be done. So there's basically $80 million of expenses incurred in 2019 that should not occur in 2020 as we go forward. So that's the first element of improvement. Second is $20 million in idle costs associated with our Plant City facility. Midyear, this year, we announced that we were permanently closing that facility. So that's now going into remediation initiatives in ARO work. And so the idle cost that we incurred in the first half of this year in our P&L will not be incurred next year."", ""So that's the next $20 million of benefit. The next tower on this slide is around Esterhazy. This year, we expect K3 to generate about 400,000 tonnes of product. Next year, it will ramp to about 1 million tonnes of product. And so on those 600,000 incremental tonnes, depending on what you assume for prices and margin, it generates an incremental $70 million to $80 million of adjusted EBITDA from just the ramp-up of K3."", ""And then finally, an additional $50 million in Brazil, and that's really from two things. One is for our synergy program, we're looking at recognizing $275 million to $325 million in synergy benefit in the P&L this year. But there are certain projects that were done within the year where you haven't captured a full year of that benefit, but you do have the run rate in place. And so that carryover into 2020, realizing a full year of benefit of those initiatives, plus some of the new initiatives that are being executed as part of the transformation 2.0, total roughly $50 million. And I would say it’s probably at a minimum $50 million. So in total, between those four things, it totals about $225 million in benefit to the company 2020 versus 2019, again, keeping prices flat."", 'Now that gives you a sense of the company and what we’re doing to transform the company. But it’s also important on how we run the company. We’ve got a couple of slides here on ESG. We get a lot of questions on that. And I would say that sustainability has been something that the company has been committed to ever since its inception. This past spring, I think we published our 10th sustainability report, providing a number of different data points and information about our program.', 'Historically, it’s been focused on energy usage, on water usage, on greenhouse gases and so forth. And as you can see, we’ve gotten a level of recognition for our program. The things I’d call out is that this year, 2019, was a second year we were included in the FTSE for Good Index, which I think is a positive thing for resource extraction companies. The other thing is that we have been for the last, I think, 10 years, have been included in the 100 Best Corporate Citizens list. And then just this morning, I got a note from our Public Affairs team that, as of today, we were just included in Newsweek’s, I think, Most Responsible Corporate Citizens list, again, pointing to the progress that we’ve made on this front.', 'Now with all of that said, we don’t focus on this to get recognition and these kind of things. And I think what we look at is we look at these things as validation of the work that we’re doing. This is an important part of what we think managing a good company is all about. We’ve taken a number of steps, again, over the last decade to be a leader on this front. And I think what we’ve seen to date from a recognition standpoint is just validation of the work that we’ve been doing.', 'Now with that said, with the addition of the production business down in Brazil last year, also, we’re now going into a new decade. Now is the time for us to kind of step back, reassess our strategy, reassess our framework, reassess the breadth of those topics that we’re wanting to cover as part of our sustainability program. We’ll bring out our formal program probably the first part of next year. But what we wanted to do this morning is to give you a sense kind of, of the framework that we’re using to develop our updated strategy.', 'And as you can see, we focus on everything from water usage to greenhouse gas to diversity to employee engagement and so forth. But really just wanted to give you a sense of the type of framework, the type of things that are front and center for us that we’re developing our strategy and metrics around for the next 10-year period. And again, we’ll provide more information on that at the beginning of next year.', 'So maybe I’ll stop there, and I’ll hand the mic over to Andy to take us through some of the different markets around the world.']",management_discussion,MOS_162169
1036,Andy Jung,"['All right. Thanks, Clint. So we’ve seen a lot of questions or heard a lot of questions this week and in previous weeks about the challenges faced in 2019 and what 2020 might have in store. So with these next few slides, I just want to kind of dance around the world in some of the major markets and talk about, briefly, what transpired in 2019 and presented the problems or challenges and then where we see the market going as we shift to a new year and, hopefully, a much more constructive year, at least in our view.', 'So when we look at North America, I think everybody is aware that North America, the spring season was the major problem that occurred in the fertilizer space or in the ag space in general. And the problem was wet weather truncated the season, delayed planting and presented a challenge to get fertilizers applied to the field. And that is now behind us. What we’ve seen as we’ve moved into the fall, that harvest has certainly been late and presented its own challenges in order to get into the fields and, A, get the crop off as well as get fall fertilizer applications down.', 'So we’re not going to likely see an above-average fall here in North America, but certainly, an average fall looks to be in the offing. And that average fall has allowed channel inventories to be worked through, particularly so for potash, where we’ve seen producers take curtailments to manage their inventories. The retail channel has been moved through or cleared out as farmers have lifted those tonnes to put them to the ground.', 'Phosphate, because of the relatively high level of imports that we’ve continued to see in 2019, there is more channel inventory in that space relative to average levels. But at the retail level, it appears that inventories are relatively low. And at the producer level, they’re pretty average. So as we move into 2020, we think that there is still a lot of pent-up demand for both P&K in North America. And given a normal spring as opposed to the very disastrous spring weather that we saw in 2019, we would anticipate very strong uptake of both nutrients in 2020 and pulling inventories throughout the system, whether at the producer level or the distribution and retail levels down to lower levels and make for a much more constructive pricing and margin environment.', 'Moving to South America. And obviously, Brazil is the market that is the largest in South America and the market in which Mosaic has a significant presence. So I’ll focus my remarks on that market. Demand has been nothing short of stellar in 2019. Brazil has been a significant beneficiary of the trade dispute between China and the United States. So soybeans or animal proteins that are not being exported from the U.S. to China, as was the historical norm, have largely been redirected from Brazil into China.', 'So Brazil has seen ag commodity prices at very attractive levels. They’ve seen animal protein prices at very attractive levels. And as such, their exports of soybeans, corn, poultry, beef, pork have all been record large in 2019. And that has filtered its way down into very strong fertilizer shipments. Because of that strength in demand, a lot of foreign suppliers have moved tonnes towards the Brazilian market. And as you can see from the import charts on the slide here, year-to-date, imports are running ahead of where they were a year ago. And that allowed inventories prior to their big season, which takes place the opposite of the Northern Hemisphere seasons, so it’s just wrapping up now.', 'Inventories were built in advance of that season and now have been pulled lower as we close out the year. Versus a year ago, we think that phosphates will likely end the year a little less than year-ago channel inventory levels. Potash, probably a little higher than year-ago levels. So net-net, not a significant change in Brazilian channel stocks of fertilizer products. Sets the stage for a very robust 2020 that inventories are about normal.', 'The ag economic situation in Brazil continues to be very robust. FX has deteriorated a bit, which makes their exports of extractive commodities, whether that’s ag commodities or mineral commodities, more competitive. So we think 2020 will be a very robust year again in Brazil, irrespective of what happens with the U.S.-China trade dispute. Elsewhere in South America, a fairly flat 2019, a very unexciting or nonvolatile 2019. We’d expect that to continue in 2020, probably see some moderate growth in most markets, but a very linear trend continues in most of the – rest of those countries.', 'Moving on to China. We got a tale of two nutrients here. So China, a major importer of potash and a major influencer of global potash dynamics. What we’ve seen is imports very strong year-to-date. In fact, just through Jan to October, their import volumes have met their entire 2018 or 2017 import volumes. Their imports are now tapering off pretty dramatically because there is no current contract in place. Those of you that are following port inventories of potash in China, they remain generally elevated versus year-ago levels, but they are being pulled lower.', 'If you go back a few weeks, they’re about 3.5 million or 3.6 million tonnes. They’re now down closer to the 3 million-tonne threshold. And as we get through December and into January, we would expect those inventory levels to be pulled down to a threshold whereby the Chinese are behooved to signing new contracts. So early in 2020, we would expect to see a new potash contract in for Chinese buyers.', 'On the phosphate side, their exports of phosphate are one of the main swing factors in global phosphate markets and have an influence on global pricing dynamics. Through the first half of the year, Chinese phosphate exports were significantly higher than year-ago levels. So through – the run rate through July, they were exporting or had exported nearly 1 million tonnes more than they had in 2018. That was one of the main drivers of price weakness in the phosphate space simply as those tonnes moved into markets and filled the channel.', 'What we’ve seen over the last couple of months, there was a significant and sharp reversal of fortunes in Chinese exports as largely, economics have come to bear on their ability or willingness to export. So now their run rate through October is 750,000 tonnes less than a year ago. So they went from 1 million tonnes higher than a year ago in July to 3.25 million tonnes less than a year ago through October. So a very sharp change in fortunes. That reality is probably not being borne out in global market prices, but I suspect that it will begin to influence pricing dynamics in the very near future. Our expectation for next year is a continuation of that trend, probably a slow decline, yet again, in export volume coming out of China.', 'And lastly, as we move into India and Southeast Asia, Southeast Asia, from a potash standpoint, was a very significant drag on demand in 2019, and the reason being that crude palm oil prices were at very low levels, very uneconomic levels for plantation operators in that geography. If you look, shipments were down about 1 million tonnes year-over-year from over 5 million tonnes to barely better than 4 million tonnes in 2019.', 'Over the last few weeks, however, in response to lower production of crude palm oil, because they did not fertilize to maximize yields in 2019 but as well as the announced program for increasing palm oil use in biodiesel in Indonesia, we’ve seen a very sharp recovery in palm oil prices. So versus year-ago November 2018 lows, prices are now up about 50%. So a very constructive change in palm oil production economics, and we would expect to see 2020 potash shipments respond very favorable to that change.', 'If we look at India, the phosphate space there is pretty important to look at. Imports are down year-over-year. And the reason for that is India imported a lot in the latter stages of 2018 and built some inventory. But in 2019, what we’ve seen is demand has been absolutely stellar. Demand has been up about 10% year-over-year. So they have worked through that buildup of inventories and balanced their current import levels in line with their needs. So they should end the year at similar inventory levels to a year ago. And with a very good monsoon behind us now, we would expect that demand will be very robust in the rabi season and again be robust as we move into 2020. Back to you, Clint.']",management_discussion,MOS_162169
1037,Clint Freeland,"['Okay. Good. Thank you, Andy. So I think as we look long term for Mosaic, I think the continued demand for products globally that we make, I think, is going to be there. It continues to be there. And I think the transformation initiatives that we have going on within all of our business units, but particularly in potash and in Brazil, are very significant and fundamentally change those two businesses going forward for the good from a profitability, cash flow and resiliency standpoint.', 'And so I think long term, the ability of the company to meet global demand, I think, is strong. And to be able to navigate periods like 2019 and then also benefit from stronger markets like we expect in 2020 is certainly there. And looking forward, more short term, as Andy outlined, there are a number of factors that make it at least appear at this point that 2020 should be a much better year.', 'On the one hand, we’ve got constructive grain and oil seed prices for next year’s harvest, which incents farmers to plant. You’ve got farmer economics and farmer financial positions that are in fairly good shape. You’ve got a depleted nutrient bank, particularly in the U.S. from a couple of suboptimal application seasons. And then on top of that, the very thing that the soil needs, which is nutrients, are very affordable at today’s prices.', 'And so the incentives are there. It’s just a matter of, do you get the windows of opportunity to put it down and to get it done. And our view is that to the extent that applications revert back to more average type of profile, that 2020 should be a very good year.', 'So maybe I’ll stop there and see if there are any questions.']",management_discussion,MOS_162169

1039,Clint Freeland,"['That is irrespective of what prices do, right? So I don’t want to say what prices are going to be. All I’m saying is that there’s no price impact to those numbers. So the $225 million should be additive to the company regardless of where – what prices do in 2020, either positive or negative.']",question_answer,MOS_162169
1040,Unidentified Analyst,"['Just a question on that Chinese potash contract. Do you expect them to sign a long contract? I mean there was expectations last year that they might actually sign for over a year. Would they make the most of low pricing? And just – and then a second question on pricing. Obviously, we’ve seen, I think, the better Russians sign up with the Indians, and historically, that’s been used to surprise matter with over to the Chinese. What do you see, the kind of seaborne spot price is a better reflection of where the Chinese might settle?']",question_answer,MOS_162169
1041,Andy Jung,"['So our expectation would be that – just the first part of your question, the – our expectation is that China would sign an annual-type contract. There’s no overarching indication that they want a shorter or a longer-duration contract. So status quo is probably the safest place to plant our flag. From a timing perspective, I mentioned earlier that we would expect that to be in the early stages of 2020, so call it, February to – if you wanted to pick a month. And India, for sure, is being settled prior to China, is certainly a signal to the Chinese as well as the Southeast Asian buyers that here is the new normal benchmark price that others can pivot off of.', 'Basis current spot pricing of rail tonnes coming across into China, one would expect that the price could be settled at more than the $10 decline team with the India contract settlement but probably not dramatically more than that. And frankly, SMB dynamics can change between now and February or whenever the contract is settled. We would expect to see demand starting to spring back imminently, particularly with Southeast Asian tenders. They will start buying, and that will be probably a better signal of what the Chinese contract will settle out at eventually or when it does.']",question_answer,MOS_162169

1043,Andy Jung,"['There’s not a lot of data points, so hard data points other than what we know our sales book has been and the pull from our owned warehouses as well as our exclusive space warehouses. And we wouldn’t say that it’s stacking up to be an average fall. I think the demand would have been there for an outstanding fall after the very poor spring, but we’ve seen the weather truncate the ability of farmers to get out into the field or the retailers to go out and move fertilizer. The fall is not over, and we could see the fall continue into January and even February. There’s no magical date. When we say that it’s no longer fall and – it’s spring application season. So there’s still the opportunity for the fall to be better than average. But I think right now, the safest bet would be to say it’s going to be an average fall.']",question_answer,MOS_162169

1046,Clint Freeland,"['Okay. That’s good to know. So it’s average relative to long-term norm, which is better than last year.']",question_answer,MOS_162169
1047,P.J. Juvekar,"['One of the fertilizer consultants recently mentioned that the 2019 application of P&K was down 10%. I think there was a global number.

1048,Andy Jung,"['You probably won’t get a full 10% back. And our estimation is that roughly 10%. Between the fall of 2018 and the spring of 2019, P&K demand application was probably impacted somewhere in the neighborhood of 10%. You’re unlikely to get all of that back in the immediate term simply because there will be other pockets of problematic weather or delays that prevent all of those tonnes from being made up. You will also see that yields were impacted negatively because of lateness and because of lack of technology applied to those fields. So there is less to be replaced from the current crop that’s being pulled off. So you won’t get the full 10%, but you can very easily see up 5%, up 7%, up 8% in the spring season.']",question_answer,MOS_162169
1049,P.J. Juvekar,['And then question on your Ma’aden investment. You mentioned in third quarter that you don’t expect a lot of equity earnings from Ma’aden. I mean Ma’aden is supposed to be low cost in Saudi Arabia. So why aren’t you seeing that? Any specific reasons there?'],question_answer,MOS_162169
1050,Clint Freeland,"['Yes. So I think it’s really two things. One is it’s not at full ramp-up at this point. I think this year, it’s probably around 2.2 million tonnes of production relative to capacity of three. And so there’s a level of inefficiency associated with the ramp-up. The other thing is that it does have $5 billion of debt on it and associated debt service. So call it a couple hundred million dollars of debt service. And all of that flows through the equity earnings, right? So I think you’re right, at the point of production, raw material cost or rock cost and so forth is very efficient. But I do think that there is a level of drag, particularly this year, associated with ramp-up. And then on an ongoing basis, you will see the effect of the debt load.']",question_answer,MOS_162169

1053,Andy Jung,"['It’s probably a mix of both that anytime you see a significant step higher in global shipments, some of that is probably channel inventory building.

1063,Joc O’Rourke,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings discussion. Yesterday after the market closed we released third quarter results which continued to reflect known challenges, with fertilizer prices impacted by high channel inventories in North America and slowing potash shipments into Asia.', 'With that said, we are beginning to see developments in the market that are constructive on both these points. First, fertilizer is now being applied in North America. We expect a shortened but aggressive application season, which is needed to reduce channel inventories and set the stage for a strong spring season.', 'Second, India recently settled its potash agreements, which sets a benchmark price and opens the door for product shipments to start moving.', 'In the U.S. the late harvest and below trend crop yields have pushed corn and soybean prices higher, improving farmer economics for the next year and making fertilizer application more attractive.', 'In addition, soils are depleted as weather has prevented farmers from applying the appropriate amounts of fertilizer. This is a combination of factors that bodes very well for fertilizer demand heading into 2020.', 'Clint will provide details on our third quarter earnings, along with an explanation of some abnormal expenses running through the period, including a tax accrual, which by itself impacted adjusted earnings by $0.10 a share. I will focus on our outlook, as well as the actions we are taking to maximize our free cash flow.', 'One key trend to note as we look forward to prices recovering is it phosphate and potash prices behave very differently, with potash moving more slowly and phosphates correcting sharply. Price increases lag volume movements, especially when we are starting from high inventory positions.', 'In phosphates, we expect prices to rise as strong demand reduces North American inventories and we have position product strategically to capture time place premiums in key Midwest growing regions. We also expect phosphate demand to remain strong in other regions, including Brazil, where our production assets give us a meaningful advantage.', 'On the supply side, Chinese phosphate exports are slowing as environmental regulations and economic pressures take effect. At the same time, we have curtailed production and the ramp up of new supply from Saudi Arabia and Morocco is largely complete.', 'Potash demand was similarly impacted by high North American inventories and a delay in contract settlements, pressuring potash prices. Large potash producers have curtailed production to match supply to demand.', 'Throughout 2019, Mosaic has continued to focus on strengthening the business, creating additional leverage to market improvement and financial returns. We have managed cash and capital prudently, and have maintained our strong financial position. We have lowered sustaining CapEx for the year and have reaffirmed our commitment to shareholder returns by repurchasing $150 million in Mosaic shares year-to-date.', 'We have demonstrated our long held commitment to market discipline, curtailing both phosphate and potash production during periods of market weakness. We have retained our ability to resume production quickly as market strengthened.', 'In Brazil, our Mosaic Fertilizantes business has completed all the actions required to reach its $275 million synergy target in 2019, a year ahead of schedule and we believe we can achieve up to $50 million more in excess of what the target was this year.', 'We have also kicked off a new program to generate an additional $200 million of EBITDA contribution after 2019, through a mixture of operational improvements, further cost reductions and additional revenue.', 'Finally, our Esterhazy K3 project is ramping up well. At our Analyst Day this past March, we announced that we were accelerating development of the project by a full year and momentum towards that goal has been better than anticipated.', 'As a result, we see an opportunity to pull the project forward by an additional year, allowing us to end all brand management spending and realize the full benefits of significantly lower production costs by mid 2022. All this work clearly has strengthened our foundation and position Mosaic for success in a cyclical seasonal business.', 'Initially harvested yields in North America were coming in line with modest expectations. As more acres are harvested, we are seeing yields come in lower. There are a lot of acres yet to harvest but our expectation is that yields will continue to slip lower and commodity prices will continue to rise.', 'In the U.S. for 2020, we are forecasting 93 million acres of corn planting and 85 million acres of soybeans. The combination of nutrient depleted soils, more planted acres and excellent affordability of crop nutrients bodes well for fertilizer demand into 2020.', 'The risk in 2019 continues to be the length of the application window is possible like in 2017. That fall application extends past year end. We believe farmers will make every effort to apply fertilizer in the fall with memories of spring 2019 challenge is so fresh. What farmers can’t apply this fall will be applied in the spring.', 'Our outlook remains bullish, as we expect strong demand to pull down access inventories and prices to improve as we move into 2020.', 'Now, I will ask Clint to provide more insight into our third quarter results and our outlook for fourth quarter and next year.']",management_discussion,MOS_160035
1064,Clint Freeland,"['Thank you, Joc. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining our call. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $366 million and adjusted earnings per share were $0.08. The company generated close to $500 million in cash from operations, with half of that cash being reinvested in our business and the majority of the balance being returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Cash balances end the quarter at $641 million.', 'On a segment basis, solid performance in potash and Mosaic Fertilizantes was offset by continued weakness in phosphates primarily due to downward pressure on market prices. The potash business unit performed well.', 'Volumes were at the midpoint of the range and adjusted gross margin per tonne came in strong as both prices and costs were better than expected. While we were pleased with third quarter results in potash, we do see challenges in the fourth quarter specifically around volumes as we await completion of the China contract.', 'In phosphates, while volumes were on the low end of our range adjusted gross margin per tonne remained at negative $6. As a $13 per tonne benefit from lower raw material costs was offset by declines in average sales prices.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes continued its strong performance with adjusted gross margin per ton of $39 reflecting strong distribution margins and favorable product mix. Global phosphate price pressures did not impact Mosaic Fertilizantes as much as our phosphate segment. As the Brazilian product mix is more diversified and its distribution business generates more consistent margins.', 'Sales volume during the quarter were initially delayed due to dry weather, but are now progressing well and we expect to finish the year strong. We continue to expect Brazil to set another record for total fertilizer shipments this year.', 'And finally, there were a few items worth noting that impacted results beyond segment performance starting with our effective tax rates. As we have discussed in the past, earnings mix plays a large role in our tax rates and as phosphate results have continued to weaken, our expected tax rate for the year has risen, as a higher proportion of earnings are expected to come from Canada and Brazil, both of which are higher tax jurisdictions in the U.S. As a result, we now expect our effective tax rate for the ear to be in the mid-30% range compared to the mid-to-high 20% range we discussed last quarter.', 'Given this, we booked a catch up accrual during the third quarter, as well as a required interim period accrual that will reverse when we close the books at year end. These two third quarter accruals totaled $39 million impacting third quarter EPS by $0.010 per share.', 'In addition, we recorded $62 million of other operating expense, $48 million after notables, which is approximately twice what we would expect in the normal quarter. $23 million of the total adjusted expense is due to increases in legal reserves in Brazil and non-recurring re-class of prior operating costs.', 'The higher than normal legal reserves negatively impacted our adjusted EPS by $0.02 per share at our estimated full year effective tax rate. These were not treated as notables to be consistent with past practice. Excluding these tax and other expense items, Mosaic’s adjusted EPS for the quarter would have been $0.20.', 'The Mosaic Fertilizantes segment has realized $230 million of net synergies in its P&L through the third quarter of this year and we expect to finish the year strong. As many of the synergies flow through our cost of goods sold, ultimate realization depends on sales volumes.', 'Based on current sales forecast for the fourth quarter, we expect to exceed our $275 million target for this year by up to $50 million, demonstrating the continued acceleration of synergy recognition on a per tonne basis quarter-over-quarter.', 'Earlier this year, we announced the next phase of business improvement in Brazil, with a target of achieving an additional $200 million in adjusted EBITDA by 2022. This program is not simply an extension of our synergy program, but new initiatives that will build on our accomplished to-date', 'In addition to strong execution in Brazil, the company is executing very well on the K3 development in Canada, which we believe is one of the best performing potash projects in the world.', 'We announced a one year acceleration of the project at our Analyst Day earlier this year and now believe we can accelerate the project by an additional 12 months to 18 months, as minor assembly times have been reduced to three months compared to four months under the first acceleration, and six months in the original plan.', 'While this acceleration will pull CapEx forward, we expect to remain below budget for the total project. Faster project execution will allow us to increase total brine management cost savings to $225 million and accelerate $75 million in operating cost reductions by more quickly migrating production from K1 and K2 to K3.', 'This $300 million of cost savings is significant. It’s roughly equivalent to 10% of gross capital spending on the K3 project and a third of net capital spending, and helps generate an unlimited after tax IRR in excess of 25% on all accelerated capital spend.', 'As we look to the balance of the year, we have adjusted our full year guidance to reflect results through the third quarter, as well as sales expectations and more recent pricing levels for both potash and phosphates. Based on these factors, we now see adjusted EBITDA at $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion and adjusted EPS at $0.50 to $0.60.', 'Some of the key assumptions in our forecast include the following. First, over 50% of our phosphates and potash sales are priced, reducing our exposure to changes in market prices.', 'Second, we expect potash sales volumes for the fourth quarter of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes and gross margin per tonne of $60 to $70.', 'Our previously announced 600,000 tonne curtailment was in response to changing near-term demand expectations and is now reflected in the sales volumes we expect for the quarter. This assumes no China and minimal India tonnes and market prices as of October 24th.', 'For the phosphate business unit, we expect sales volumes of 2 million tonnes to 2.3 million tonnes and adjusted gross margin per tonne from negative 10 to zero, which assumes market prices as of October 24th, approximately $15 lower than third quarter averages.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes is expected to sell a total of 2.2 million tonnes to 2.4 million tonnes of finished product, most of which is already committed.

Mosaic is taking action not only to navigate through the current environment, but also to really set ourselves up for the future, streamline, improve and strengthen the business, and again, we'll talk a little bit more about that. And then as we look forward beyond 2019 and to 2020 and 2021, we are taking action and doing things to improve the earnings and cash flow profile of the company regardless of where you are in the pricing cycle for fertilizer. So those really are kind of the three highlights for today."", 'So, as Chris mentioned, 2019 certainly has been a challenging year in the Ag space in fertilizer, and notably in phosphates. You know they say a picture is worth a thousand words, and I think some these pictures really tell the story of 2019 at least so far this year. First, we had a weaker than expected fall application last fall due to cold and wet weather, and then came into the spring and had just unprecedented rain and flooding in the American upper Midwest. You can see some of the snapshots here that tell that story. And then to me the pictures that really tell the wider story are the pictures the right.', ""If you look at the top right photo, it's a satellite photo obviously the upper Midwest, lot of green, lot of things growing, lot of things happening. That was from June 2018. If you look at the bottom slide, lot of brown and particularly in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. It's a stark difference to what's happening in 2018. And the reason for that is, because of the weather certainly had a late harvest, no not late harvest, late planting, sorry, and that really has caused a lot of disruptions in some of the Ag related markets and fertilizer is no different."", ""Typically when you see these type of events and disruptions in markets where supply and demand are out of balance, prices are reacting, most of the time those are due to supply changes, which are structural in nature, take an extended period of time to work through. That's typically what you see. That's not what we think we're seeing this year. And we'll go through a chart here in just a moment, that I think demonstrates the point, but what we're seeing and what we believe is happening is that because of the late planting season, because the effect that it has had on application, again particularly on phosphates, is that this is more driven by the demand side, a significant decline in demand as a result of the weather, which has then backed up inventories in the system. It left a lot of products stranded on the Mississippi River that couldn't get to market. Prices plummeted as a result."", ""And so, as we go forward, one of the things that we believe needs to happen in order to get this back to more constructive supply/demand balance, is first of all get back to a more normal application rhythm. But also we need to accelerate the removal of excess inventory in the system. And obviously given Mosaic's position, we have a part to play in that, we'll talk about that here in just a moment."", ""This next slide I think kind of tells also part of the story. When we look at 2018, I think the view at that time was that the global supply/demand balance was more constructive, was more in line on a global basis even considering some of the incremental supply coming online from the Moroccans and the Saudis and others, but in starting last fall with a weaker application season and then of course going into the spring, you've seen that imbalance materialize and prices react."", ""Now as of last Friday, the global net price for phosphates, which is a metric that we use, we had $239 per metric ton, which is roughly equivalent to right in the ballpark of the lows that we saw in 2016 and 2017, in fact just in the third quarter global net prices come down about $15 and I think DAP and NOLA has come down over $30 to $35. But as we look at that scenario and that situation, the analysis that we've done internally suggests that the producers that are in the top half of the supply stack globally are under significant financial stress. And it is our belief that that can only go on for so long before there is a reaction. And so, as we look at this, certainly this process has been painful over the last 12 months, but in our view we are either at or certainly near the bottom of this cycle."", ""Now through all of this, one of the things that we've seen with our business is the benefit of diversification. We have three main businesses, three main business segments being Potash, Phosphates and Brazil. And what we've seen this year is that our Potash business has performed very well. Our Brazilian business, despite some of the dam issues that we had to manage through this year, that has performed very well. So two of our three business units performed very well and those two businesses were able to offset a meaningful portion of the impact of the phosphates market that we've seen this year."", ""But with all that said, we're not sitting around. We're taking action and not just to manage through the current dynamics that we see in our markets, but also to continue to improve and strengthen the business that we have for the future. The actions that we've taken year-to-date include the acceleration of our K3 mine at Esterhazy in Canada, it is a potash facility, and as a result of the success and momentum of that project, we've been able to temporarily idle our Colonsay facility, which is a little bit higher facility, shift some production over to our K3 facility and capture about $60 million to $70 million in cash benefits just this year."", ""Additionally, as I'm sure most of you are aware, we have had to manage through some dam regulatory issues down in Brazil this year, and our team down there has executed very, very well, getting through that remediation work ahead of schedule and certainly well ahead of budget. We originally thought we would need to spend $100 million managing through that situation this year, looks like it's only going to be $80 million."", ""Now what we announced yesterday were another set of steps that we're taking to actively manage our business, again to kind of navigate the current environment, but also to set ourselves up for the future. First, as Chris mentioned, we announced a curtailment of 500,000 tons of production this year by idling our facility in Louisiana."", ""As we talked about earlier, we think that part of the solution to the phosphate market issue in North America is removing some of the excess inventory that's in the system and will continue to service our main customers, our key customers out of our inventory. That facility will remain idle until we work through that inventory, then we'll bring that facility back up. And so really this is meant to and intended to accelerate the rebalancing of the supply and demand in North America."", ""Second, I think we had spoken before about our confidence in achieving our synergy targets down in Brazil this year and we're reiterating that. We believe that we'll meet or exceed our 275 million and realize synergies in the P&L this year. But we've also spoken about the fact that it doesn't just end there. We continue to see transformation opportunities down in Brazil and yesterday we announced the next phase of that business transformation where over the next three years we believe that we can take steps to improve the EBITDA profile by $200 million on a recurring basis. And that comes in the form of revenue, it comes in the form of cost, and efficiency. So that's - it's not just a cost reduction exercise, it's really a business efficiency and transformation exercise."", ""And then finally we announced a $250 million share buyback. When we look at our capital allocation and use of capital, we don't see any more compelling opportunities to deploy our capital into as into our own shares at the current price levels. Also I was fearful, [ph] I can't help but at least observe that in buying our Brazil business which has been such a success and is getting even better, we issued stock as part of that acquisition at a price higher than today's level and so through this buyback we should be able to buyback roughly a third of the shares that we issued as part of that."", ""So that's what we're doing in 2019. As we look past 2019 and the 2020 I think it's important to note that there are a number of things that are happening, a number of differences between 2019 and 2020 that will structurally benefit our EBITDA going forward relative to this year regardless of where prices go. The first is, as I mentioned earlier, that we're spending about $80 million that's hitting the P&L this year and managing through the dam remediation down in Brazil."", ""Second, we have previously had a Plant City facility idle, that typically will cost about $50 million a year. We've now decided to permanently close that. That P&L cost will go to $10 million. Since we made that decision midyear, the change between '19 and '20 will be a total of about $20 million or between that and Brazil that's about $100 million difference between the two years coming out of the gate."", ""Next is, I talked about the acceleration of our Esterhazy K3 project, we expect that production to ramp from 400,000 tons this year to about 1 million tons next year, 600,000 ton difference. And given the cost structure of that and depending on what we view prices as next year, it's roughly $75 million improvement in EBITDA as a result of the ramping of that facility."", ""And then finally, we have another, call it $50 million in upside from Brazil as we look at the projects that have already gone into place above and beyond the synergy target, the run rate that's associated with those projects, as well as some of the other initiatives, we would expect at least another $50 million in benefit in 2020 that we're not experiencing in 2019. So in total, as we look between the two years, again independent of where prices are going, we see a structural improvement of call it $200 million or $225 million in adjusted EBITDA."", 'And then if we go one year further into 2021, number of months ago or earlier this year we had an Analyst Day and as part of that Analyst Day we talked about how we see $600 million improvement in adjusted EBITDA for the company between 2019 and 2021 and two thirds of that or roughly $400 million is associated with items that we control, operational improvements, volume increases and so forth.', ""And I think as we look at the work that's ongoing, again around the K3 acceleration, what that means for increased production, lower cash cost of production ultimately eliminating brine cost as that ramps up, the phosphate transformation, and again the Fertilizantes transformation, we believe that we're making very solid progress toward the goals and objectives that we set out for 2021."", 'I would also note that within that estimate of $400 million of controllable improvements, we only estimate about a $70 million improvement in Brazil above and beyond synergies. Obviously with the new targets that we put out, I think that can and probably should be viewed as somewhat conservative.', 'The other thing that I would note is, one third of the $600 million improvement was based on price decks from CRU at the time. we also provided sensitivities for the business so that investors could as prices change, which we all know that they will, can at least calibrate and recalibrate based on changes in prices, and so certainly something to keep an eye on, but as we look at what are the things that we control to hit those targets, we remain on target to do that.', ""So I'll maybe wrap up and enclose that. Again as we look at our business this year, certainly it has been a challenging year, particularly in phosphates, but again we think that that is more transitory in nature and I think with steps like what we're doing with our curtailment and working through excess inventory, that we can get back to a more constructive supply/demand balance over time."", 'We continue to take steps to drive efficiency in our business, to improve our cost structure, improve our efficiency, and improve the strength of the company again, so that we can drive a better level of earnings and cash flow regardless of where you are in the pricing environment. And we continue to make progress on the transformation initiatives that we laid out earlier in the year on our Analyst Day, all with an objective of continuing to run the company as well as we possibly can. So maybe I will stop there and ask for questions.']",management_discussion,MOS_157968
1117,Christopher Parkinson,"['Maybe just to kick one-off is, you showed a chart there that, it indicates that phosphate prices are either at or near low. There have been a few moving factors, currency, lower sulfur prices in China, et cetera, that are in my opinion, at least all contributing to that. But when you look at the actual supply/demand picture from 2019 through 2021, and what else is there to come online?', ""I mean, obviously, you've seen some expansions in the Middle East, North Africa, et cetera, but we're at low in the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter quartile producers are already under pressure, but what else do you feel they are worried about over the next two to three seasons?""]",question_answer,MOS_157968
1118,Clint Freeland,"[""Well, I think from a structural supply/demand balance, I don't think that there are many surprises that are out there. I think even last year, we expected a ramp up of Moroccan production, we expected and our joint venture partners in the Ma'aden rampup. So, beyond that, there's no - from a supply standpoint, scale supply standpoint, I don't think there are any big surprises out there. I think the thing to watch though is what happens in China. And I think there is may be different opinions on what's going to happen and probably not a lot of clarity."", ""Obviously, this year we've seen a lot of exports out of China. At the end of this year, they need to go through a new permitting process. There's -- there are a lot of different dynamics happening in China that can affect how much is actually produced there and how much is export. And so to me, that's the biggest thing to watch. And then kind of second thing to watch is how quickly again, can we kind of work through the excesses that have built up in the system in North America and get back to a more constructive supply/demand balance in that region.""]",question_answer,MOS_157968
1119,Christopher Parkinson,"[""And the other thing that's been going on due to delayed planting inventories, as you highlighted North America and obviously you're now taking significant action. Can you also comment on your own strip margin outlook? Obviously, there's been a lot of volatility in some of your own raw materials over the last several quarters. I would say and most notably the sulfur price. But can you kind of just give us a sense of your given where you stand right here right now and how you think the inventory clearing will occur once we see some of those benefits from lower feedstocks or just what's the best way to think about that heading into 2020?""]",question_answer,MOS_157968
1120,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes, I guess a number of thoughts there. First, when you look at sulfur as an example, we have a -- portion of our sulfur is Prill Sulfur, right. It's a little bit higher cost, but then you have to melt it and so it's higher costs. And so, that's something to take into consideration that we have a blend, the vast majority is multiple but there is a component of Prill which tends to be more expensive."", ""And then as you see things working through inventory and actually hitting cost of goods sold, there typically is a lag. And depending on inventory levels and production levels, that could be two months, maybe sometimes three. And so, it's kind of hard to do kind of a mark-to-market to current numbers in the press and get it right."", ""And so, you need to kind of account for the fact that that lags. On ammonia, we get ammonia from three different sources. We produce ammonia in Louisiana, that's our lowest cost. We buy quite a bit on the open market. And then we have a long-term contract with CF for ammonia. And depending on where ammonia prices are, sometimes we're going to look better than the market, sometimes we're going to look a little bit worse than the market. And it's really a matter of the blend of those three and that can change over time. And something that, that we’re actually talking to a group of investors about a little bit earlier today is that our ammonia facilities in Louisiana, it's part of the Louisiana Complex that is being temporarily idled over the next few months."", ""Now, most of that really all of that ammonia goes into production in Louisiana. So both of them coming down will make sense, right? But, what you likely will see as you adjust for that, for that outage and that production, is you'll probably see just the blending of our third-party CF contract with markets, so it may look like our ammonia costs were a little bit higher when nothing really changed, because that's the blend that we historically have used in Florida anyway."", ""Again, I think with ammonia as you kind of look at the market and as it's changing, again there's a lag as it moves through inventory into production, finished products, it's an inventory and then it's sold, so call that two to three months. And so again, I think as people are modeling us and looking at us, you really need to take the lag out of those raw materials into account, particularly as the market is changing meaningfully.""]",question_answer,MOS_157968
1121,Christopher Parkinson,"[""And we look at your overall call, you had two great slides, one of which I think is not necessarily new, just the way you constructed. It was obviously for the messaging of this audience and everybody else. You've got some near term factors, all else equal 2020 versus 2019. Brazil synergy capture run rates, obviously the lack of the cost headwinds you faced in 2019, as well as of Plant City. You also have a few initiatives, which you glanced over us."", ""I was just hoping to get a little more detail on what else you've done a longer term in terms of Esterhazy, what is Esterhazy E3 actually mean in terms of your production costs and then also, something you highlighted at your Analyst Day is further reduction in overall for rock costs.

1122,Clint Freeland,"['Yes, so our K3 mine is, is really the next generation of our potash business. We believe that once K3 is fully up and operational, that it will be one of the most efficient mines in the world. Generally, it will be fully automated, I think the cost to deliver will be extremely competitive.', 'And, and along with it, what it really means for us is that, we have currently two other mines, K1 and K2 that are producing. And actually, we were talking about this with investors a little bit earlier, where when you go down the shafts of K1 and K2 to get to the face of the mine, you have to get into a Jeep, and you have to drive for 45 minutes to actually get to the face of the mine where K3 dropped down the shaft and block away is the face.', ""And when you kind of think about what that means from an efficiency standpoint, and then adding automation to that, I think it's exceptional. The other element of it, though, is for the last 30 years, we've been managing brine inflow at K1 and K2."", ""At one point, our costs was $250 million a year, just to manage that, it's down to about $140 million including depreciation. At this point, we see that stepping down over time, but that costs will ultimately be eliminated. And that risk will be eliminated from the complex once K3 is fully up and operational, we’re able to migrate to the new facility."", ""But it's a very efficient investment for us because all of the above ground milling infrastructure is going to be leveraged. So we've already connected to K3 mine, with one conveyor to one of the above ground milling facilities, we’ll do second conveyor to second facility. And so when we think about the ultimate task and the returns associated with it, it's a pretty compelling investment, it reduces risk, and it significantly reduces our costs from a cost of operation production and from the Brian cost."", ""And then when you think about it from a cash standpoint, compared to today, we're spending roughly $300 million in CapEx this year, about $100 million to manage brine, but with $400 million in cash that will go away once K3 is up and operational, the maintenance CapEx from K1 and K2 that spend will simply migrate over to K3, there should be about $400 million cash benefit, regardless of where prices are relative to today."", ""So I mean, it's a very meaningful step for the company. And again, we've announced the acceleration of that project originally, we expect it to be full operation by 2024. Looks like it'll now be 2023. And I would also say that, I think the company is there's a lot of momentum associated with that acceleration. And so, I think there's probably more information to come in the future about kind of what that means for us, but I think that's a really good story for us. And then for Florida Rock [ph] cost, I mean that is also an important element of our phosphate business."", ""One of the things that we're doing this year is actually extending some of our reserves in Florida. And also one of the things that we're doing is, through various transformation initiatives, we thought that, as you mine further and further away from the above ground infrastructure, and the chemical plants that we would need to build a new beneficiation plant, those are very expensive, new pumping infrastructure, what have you."", ""But through different technology and different capabilities that the company has developed, what we've been able to do is actually defer a lot of that CapEx because the pumping distances have gotten much, much longer, much longer than historically expected, so that we can continue to leverage the infrastructure that we already have in place without spending a significant amount of capital."", 'And so I think as we think about long-term, we will continue to put downward pressure on ultimately rock cost. But also being able to leverage the infrastructure that we have in place again, makes that more, more efficient from a capital deployment standpoint.']",question_answer,MOS_157968

We talk about transformation particularly in Brazil, because that's a relatively new platform over the last couple of years for us. And I think that it has shown even more promise than I think maybe people expected. Like I mentioned earlier we’ve been able to realize our synergies faster than expected, instead of three years, it's now two years, I think we'll meet or exceed those targets."", ""And then I think we continue to see opportunity and when I think about that acquisition, and how it's, how it is performing at this point, and the opportunity that we see, I think it's very significant in that, that requires some time to walk through because I kind of think about the synergy work as you know, as kind of cleaning things up, if you will, is a very simplified view of it, but kind of restructuring the operations there to get it the way that we want it, but now the transformation work has started. And we're seeing a very target rich environment there."", 'But then even beyond that, when we look at Brazil, we see a real growth platform. We already have a very significant distribution business there. We already have very significant production assets there.

How do we accelerate the transformation of that business? And how do we accelerate the growth? And I think that is kind of an exciting area for us.

In fact, we believe U.S. farmers were prevented from planting at least 10 million acres.', 'We now have seen two consecutive application seasons negatively impacted by weather, which in turn has driven grain prices to multiple year highs and incented farmers to make sure they are prepared to take advantage of those prices in 2020. Clearly, these same events have also impacted our first half results and tempered our full-year financial outlook.', 'Clint will give you the details to understand the factors that drove our second quarter earnings. I will focus on the actions we are taking to adopt the progress we are continuing to make across the business and our longer-term outlook. Our key points today are; first, we expect the current North American inventories to be reduced shapely through an anticipated strong fall application season and we see much stronger fundamentals for agriculture and fertilizer emerging in 2020.', 'Second, our success in ramping up Esterhazy K3 combined with our inventory position has given us the flexibility to curtail our highest cost potash mine and focused on our lowest cost operations. This action is expected to drive potash cost even lower in the second half of 2019 and save $40 million to $50 million in cash expenditures.', ""Third, we expect to have all our Brazilian phosphate mines running in August ahead of schedule and we are lowering the down related costs by $20 million from our previous estimate. Last, we've announced the permanent closure of our Plant City phosphates facility, which will improve our overall phosphate cost position and cash flow going forward. The transformation we have driven across our business units has increased Mosaic’s cross-cycle potential and has allowed us increase flexibility to adapt to a changing environment. The impact of our actions to increase our operating leverage is expected to coincide with improving market conditions."", 'The North American crop, which received much less fertilizer than usual will leave fields in serious need of nutrient replenishment. At the same time, higher grain prices will provide strong incentives for farmers to plant more acres and to maximize yields next spring.', 'Of course, North America is just one market, demand remains strong in Brazil where the farmers are seeking to maximize output in response to a favorable market conditions and as we move into their peak planting season.', ""In India, the monsoon is picking up and the recent government decision to leave phosphates subsidies unchanged is strongly positive for the long-term demand picture. In China, phosphate demand was down, offsetting some of the strong growth elsewhere. While the slower demand originally drove exports, we're now seeing phosphate exports decline as lower prices impact phosphate producer economics."", ""While today's lower phosphate prices are challenging in the short-term, we believe they can accelerate the restructuring of the Chinese industry. Year-end 2019 represents a milestone with investment required for many producers to maintain environmental compliance and current lower prices are likely to prevent some of those investments. It is our belief that marginal producers will cease production, as we move into 2020. The larger Chinese producers have announced a coordinated curtailment of production, which we are closely watching."", ""Now I will turn to our execution, which is driving important benefits across the organization. I will start with Potash. Our new Esterhazy K3 mine is performing exceptionally well. We believe it will produce 400,000 tons of Potash in 2019 and we'll approach a million tons in 2020. This incremental production at Esterhazy help to facilitate the decision to temporarily idle Colonsay and allows us to begin to realize the benefits of one of the most efficient mines in the world."", 'We continue to drive cash costs of production lower in the Potash business. In the second quarter of 2019, our cash cost of production excluding brine fell to $69 per ton and we expect cost to continue to improve as operating rates increase.', 'With the savings related to an idle Colonsay mine, we expect these cost to fall to approximately $60 a ton in the fourth quarter. That said Colonsay will remain in a position to deliver 2.5 million tons of annual surge capacity if necessary to meet market demand.', 'Our business in Brazil also continues to perform very well and we are seeing momentum for the second half of the year and beyond. Mosaic Fertilizantes is on track to achieve its $275 million synergy target ahead of schedule and we expect to drive significant transformational savings after we complete the deal related synergy work.', 'In addition, we have made tremendous progress towards meeting the new mine, tailings down regulatory standard. Mosaic has completed the first phase of dam remediation at the top your mind and has restarted mining at roughly 60% capacity.', 'The mine is expected to resume full operations by the middle of August after completing remediation activities on a second dam. The Company has also received an operating license for the B6 dam at Araxá, which is expected to allow that mine to start operations this month.', 'Our teams in Brazil have done remarkable work to get us to this point, reducing the expected impact by $20 million for the full-year. In the phosphates business, we are continuing to exert pressure on factors that we can control. The transformation of our phosphates business is ongoing and it is driving significant operational and financial efficiency while simultaneously delivering excellent safety and environmental results.', 'To be clear, our focus will remain on meeting the needs of our customers and maintaining our market position that will not change. External factors have impacted our results in near-term expectations and have led us to reduce our 2019 EBITDA guidance to $1.8 billion to $2 billion.', ""However, we've retained our keen focus on execution and controlling what is within our power. Our ability to improve efficiency, lower cost and optimize assets has created significant operating leverage in our business. Our outlook for the second half remain strong and we continue to expect broad strengths in our markets and our business in 2020 and the years ahead."", ""Now I'm going to turn it over to Clint to provide further detail.""]",management_discussion,MOS_155888
1136,Clint Freeland,"['Thank you, Joc, and good morning, everyone. As noted earlier, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS for the second quarter totaled $349 million and $0.12 per share respectively. As solid results at the Potash and Fertilizantes business units were offset by a difficult quarter in phosphates.', 'Potash adjusted EBITDA totaled $254 million for the quarter, up 27% from $199 million last year as a modest reduction in sales volume resulting from the week spring fertilizer application season in North America was more than offset by much stronger margins.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes adjusted EBITDA totaled $38 million during the quarter compared to $60 million for the second quarter of 2018, results this year include $36 million in non-recurring costs to supplement rock and finished goods supply as our team work to bring our Brazilian mine tailings dams into compliance with the new regulatory standard. Except for that, adjusted EBITDA would have been $74 million, up 23%.', ""The Phosphate segment generated adjusted EBITDA of $74 million during the quarter, compared to $251 million in the same quarter last year as sales prices, sales volume, and mix idle costs and raw material costs, all pressured results. Additionally, equity earnings associated with our investment in modern, flow through the Phosphate segment and for the quarter we're loss of $11 million."", 'Well, the segments cash gross margin before DD&A and accretion was a positive $47 per ton, reported adjusted gross margin per ton for the quarter was negative $5. Considerably lower than expected as a number of dynamics came together to impact results. As a result of week spring demand and a high level of imports trapped in the lower Mississippi river, market prices remained under pressure and the seasonal price improvement we typically see in the second quarter did not materialize.', ""Additionally, while the Midwest warehouse premium in North America remained high, we didn't capture as much of that as anticipated as North American sales, including MicroEssentials products where 350,000 to 400,000 tons lower than expected. Lower market prices along with the change in the mix of sales during the quarter and lower than expected production in sale volumes impacted margins by $45 per ton."", 'The volume and mix shift includes the impact of redirecting approximately 150,000 incremental tons of fertilizer to our international distribution businesses, primarily Brazil, and these intercompany international sales had lower margins than in North America. In addition, with overall production volumes below expectations as a result of the opportunistic extension of two plan maintenance outages, we saw higher conversion cost per ton and slower declines in raw material costs during the period.', ""These factors taken together led to the quarters results. However, it's important to note that the volume and mix impacts in the second quarter gross margin are transitory and are not expected to impact third quarter results. Additionally, as sales accelerate in the third quarter, we expect approximately $12 per ton in raw material cost improvement relative to the second quarter. Offsetting a portion of these benefits is a decline in average selling prices compared to last quarter reflecting recent market pricing levels."", 'Third quarter gross margin per ton expectations for the Potash business reflect the $25 per ton discount offered to customers as part of our North American summer fill program, as well as expenses associated with schedule turnaround activity during the period.', ""And while we expect to realize significant cash savings from the idling of our Colonsay facility as Joc mentioned earlier. We expect only a small portion of that to impact the Company's third quarter earnings as we sell down existing inventory at the facility. Margin benefits from migrating production to our lower cost K3 facility should be more significant in the fourth quarter of this year and into 2020."", 'Finally, our margin guidance for Mosaic Fertilizantes reflects the higher cost associated with purchased rock and finished product as part of our dam remediation activities. However, as mentioned earlier, we expect these to be transistorizes operations return to normal. As we look out to the balance of the year, our expectations are for a robust fall application season given depleted soil nutrients in North America and higher grain prices benefiting farmer economics.', ""Outside of North America, we expect to see continued strong demand, particularly in Brazil. We're farmer economics remains solid. As a result, we see total second half volumes for potash in a range of 4.7 million to 5.1 million tons, which would equal or break Mosaic’s previous records second half sales levels. Phosphate shipments in the second half are expected to be 4.4 million to 4.8 million tons, the highest level since idling of Plant City."", 'In addition to these strong sales volumes, we expect inventories in North America to be substantially drawn down. One of the key things to watch as we get into the fall is the length of the application window in North America given the late spring planting and resulting later harvest.', 'In Brazil, we continue to expect Fertilizantes to deliver full-year sales volumes of 9.4 million to 9.8 million tons, reflecting continued market strength in our successful remediation of the issues created by the regulatory driven closures of our Brazilian mines. With this strong demand is backdrop in both North America and Brazil keeping in mind existing inventory levels, we would expect market prices to remain stable if not improved somewhat over the balance of the year.', ""So taking first half results into account and our expectations for the balance of the year, we've updated our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $1.8 billion to $2 billion and earnings per share range to $1.10 to $1.50."", 'In addition to the volume assumptions outlined earlier, there are a number of factors that are incorporated into our forecast, including first, from a pricing standpoint, the low end of our guidance range assumes market pricing at the beginning of the third quarter for all remaining unpriced tons this year.', 'While the top end of the range reflects an average price increase of $25 per ton across both phosphates and potash. Next, we expect raw material costs to improve, as noted earlier, as we realize the benefits from recent market price declines.', 'Next as Joc mentioned, we now expect our minds in Brazil to be back to full operation this month, reducing the total cost of managing through the dam issue this year from our original estimate of $100 million to $80 million. With modern slowly ramping up production the weaker phosphate pricing environment coupled with the projects interest costs are now expected to result in equity earnings to Mosaic of approximately negative $50 million for the year.', 'And finally, expectations of cash taxes have declined from $75 million to $50 million. Our effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, is expected to remain in the mid-to-high 20% range. The biggest impact of our effective rate is earnings mix. So that remains the item to watch going forward.', ""Turning into our CapEx plans for the year, we've reduced our 2019 sustaining capital program by $80 million to $640 million in light of market conditions. We are however, continuing to invest in modest high return opportunities like the modifications to our dock in Louisiana that will allow us to use more of our own internally produced ammonia in our Florida operations. Generating an unlevered after tax return of over 40% and payback of right at two years."", ""With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joc for his closing comments.""]",management_discussion,MOS_155888
1137,James O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Clint. There was no question the market conditions have been difficult for the first half of this year. And that the impact on the full-year will be real. We have solid strategic momentum; markets notwithstanding; we have improved our cost base and our operating efficiency; we have successfully integrated and transformed a compelling acquisition in the world's most promising agricultural market."", 'We are just beginning to realize the very long-term benefit of the new Esterhazy K3 potash mine and we are performing at a very high level across the organization. We expect the current supply and demand situation will come into balance and as it does Mosaic will remain in excellent position to benefit.', 'Now we will take your questions']",management_discussion,MOS_155888

And yes, we've seen farmers in the last two to three weeks step in and start to buy their fertilizer for the second crop corn.

And I guess what I'm asking is, obviously we saw reduced usage in the U.S. this year and maybe in Europe as well. So are you thinking we get that back and then you get normal growth on top of what should have been the underlying demand growth this year? Or have we rebased 2019 volume or shipments and we'll just get normal growth off of that?""]",question_answer,MOS_155888
1147,James O'Rourke,"[""Thanks Vincent. I'll start this and hand it over to our more of our market analysis people.

It's left to prevent planting up to 10 million acres, so we expect coming out of the season a stock to use ratios, maybe as low as 10%. Well that's going to really push grain prices and really going to push planting intentions up for the spring."", ""So our expectation is we're going to have a big spring in North America and we fully expect big volumes coming out in 2020.

Maybe go through some of the various supply and demand situations in the main regions like China, India, Brazil, we know about U.S. obviously."", 'And then just secondly, like when do you expect prices to maybe, start seeing a little bit of a bottom and in a rebound and what are some of the catalysts that we can watch for ahead of that?

1158,James O'Rourke,"[""Okay. That's a bit of a doozy, Andrew. I'll get through it and I'll get Karen to help me here. But let me at a high level say, look, we've had 10 years of relatively linear growth in our phosphate markets."", 'And for the first time, I think in – probably half a dozen years, the issue with the supply and demand has been about demand and it really is predicated on mostly on a U.S. bad spring, somewhat on a lowering Chinese demand. But really other than that, pretty much a normal linear growth for the demand for phosphates.', ""So what that's meant is the equivalent of probably about a new mine coming on all of the sudden. New production is not great. It's only about 1 million tons this year I believe. And so if not for this displacement of the U.S. spring, I think the market would have continued to be a quite balance and we do expect it to rebound as early as this fall and into the spring. Karen, do you want to add any detail to that?""]",question_answer,MOS_155888
1159,Karen Swager,"[""In terms of what happened this spring. I think Joc has covered it. We had a fall four season and then we had a disappointing spring season, probably about 800,000 tons of demand was loss. At the same time though we had 1 million tons more imports into the U.S. and so that really exacerbated the problem along with the flooding along the river. So these tons were trapped in the lower Mississippi and traders started liquidating those positions very aggressively when they couldn't get tons up in country in time for spring season."", ""And so that really caused on very small amounts of trade prices to drop quickly. But that fundamental demand issue is really going to be largely overcome as Andy noted with what we think will be a large fall season and going into 2020.

Can you talk about just market structure?

It just with the magnitude of the price declines we've senior day and even with sulfur having come down, the fact that the Chinese kind a kept producing up until quite recently and even then the cuts mean to be seen, but just kind of how your view of the cost curve is evolved as the years progressed? Thank you.""]",question_answer,MOS_155888

I suppose some of that might be a misunderstanding or a missed prediction of what the spring would do, but there's no question these unpriced tons that are just shipped into these markets are pretty disruptive.

But hopefully the tightening will come soon and that's good."", ""In terms of the cost curve, we don't have – I don't think we have a good cost curve in this business, but let me give you a couple of benchmarks, so I can kind of touch on.

1177,James O'Rourke,"[""Okay. Let me start with Plant City. I think the issue there as we've been holding Plant City while not in hot ready. We've been holding it in a ready mode and we've continued to have it ready to be brought up if required. The decision to finally move it into shutdown mode does two things."", ""One, it reduces and stops those costs, obviously from a non-cash perspective at the stops, the depreciation because the depreciation was moved into a write-down. And then while we will have ARO costs or asset retirement costs, those will be not P&L based costs. So hopefully that helps on that one. And I'll hand it to Clint to give you maybe more detail on that."", ""And then Colonsay P&L, an effective date – effective date I think is early September – mid August and then the P&L impact, I got a separate P&L impact. It's going to depend on one things are sold, but we do know it will be about a $50 million cash savings. Clint, do you want to…?""]",question_answer,MOS_155888
1178,Clint Freeland,"[""Sure. Hi, Duffy, this is Clint. So on Plant City, as that facility has been kept an idle status, the total idle cost associated with that has been about $50 million a year, about half of that is depreciation, half of that is cash. Now that it has been formerly closed and now we're going into ARO work that $50 million running through the P&L will be reduced to about $10 million, again about half of that on depreciation, about half of that in cash."", ""So certainly it will be beneficial to the P&L. As we go into ARO work, I think what we've said historically is that that would be roughly an average of, call it $20 million a year over the first five years. So I think from a cash standpoint, you're probably fairly flat from a P&L standpoint, you will see an improvement."", ""And then back to Colonsay, again I think you need to separate cash versus P&L impact. I think as we've talked about a little bit earlier, we will continue to sell down the inventory at that facility. And so while we do expect to see, call it $40 million to $50 million in cash benefit this year as it relates to the P&L in the flow through of costs."", ""In the near-term, we only think that there will be about a $5 million P&L benefit. However, as that inventory is fully sold and then we switched to selling the inventory coming out of K3, that $40 million to $50 million cash benefit will now P&L benefit. But that'll be – a little bit more delayed.""]",question_answer,MOS_155888

So actually it can dampen the price declined by quite a bit. We do expect that to go to more normal one-third, one-third, one-third where we've been, but I think last quarter we were something like 40% some of CF ammonia, which makes our cost structure a little – a little higher than it would have been on just market.

Is that one of the things that we're trying to do to improve that blended cost for ammonia is to be able to use more of our internally produced ammonia out of Louisiana."", ""And so one of the things that we're doing is we're making a modest investment, in a dock in the Louisiana that will allow us to transport more of that ammonia from Louisiana to Florida to use in our operations. That again, should, allow us to bring down that average cost because that is the lowest cost source that we have. And we would expect that project to be done by the end of this year.

Thank you.', ""So my comments today will be focused on Mosaic strategy, which is designed to deliver superior long-term results to all of our shareholders. And I think it's important though to give strategy some context to really understand how it fits into the broader organizational framework of the company. And for us it all starts at the very top by having our strategy anchored to a very relevant and meaningful and compelling mission."", ""Our mission is to help the world grow the food it needs. Now this is a noble social mission, but it's also a great economic mission and it's one that really motivates our whole organization, which in turn really can drive business value. We are one of the largest fertilizer companies in the world and we know that fertilizer accounts for about 50% of all crops grown around the world. So it's not difficult to see where the products we make the billions of people every year. So we really believe on that basis that what we do is important for food security around the world."", ""Now fertilizer supply and demand is always going to be variable, it's always going to be dynamic and shifting. But the one thing I can say for sure is, there is no question that demand will increase with growing population and growing wealth around the world. So, you can't feed the growing world without our fertilizer to help. And from my perspective that's great news for Mosaic, but also great news for all of our stakeholders."", 'Now, but we go from the mission to the vision, four years ago when I was appointed as CEO with this compelling mission in mind, the senior leadership team and I set about to develop a clear vision of what mosaic should look like in the future. And we set out to build and sustain the most competitive resilient, profitable and responsible company in our space, one that is highly focused on delivering superior long-term value across the business cycle.', ""Now to do this, we had to transform our business and our culture which we did and we continue to do. So at the core then of our strategy is which we call win and grow is the transformation of our company and how we are changing that company. We call our strategy to win and grow because we look at it to say, we want to be highly competitive and win in the markets in our core phosphate and potash business, which will give us the financial strength to leverage to grow the company in ways that will add long-term value. We launched this strategy about three years ago and it was meant to be highly agile and very responsive because the one thing we do know is things don't stand still from an environment perspective, from the markets, our competitors, or our operating environment."", ""Now, if I had to pick one word of our strategy that really sums up the win portion. It's competitiveness. And what we felt we had to do was really improve our competitiveness. So we've aggressively managed and optimized our assets and our cost. For example, over the last five years, U.S. mined rock costs are down 7% in our phosphate business; in potash cash costs per ton are down 28% and productivity has improved by 43%. We are significantly improving our back office and support staff as well. SG&A today is down to $12 per ton from over $20 a ton five years ago and that's a 30% improvement and we're not done yet. We're continuing to work hard on this."", ""Our balance sheet is strong and positioned to support our strategy and we're leveraging the power of our employees and technology to really move business value. So that's the first half of the strategy."", ""The second piece is what we call grow value. And to do this, we've made significant progress as well. Now, here we're looking at what can we do to leverage our existing business and our capabilities to really add value to the company. Mosaic Fertilizantes, the combination of our fertilizer distribution business and Vale's fertilizer business is an excellent example of a well executed acquisition and integration. Here, we purchased and successfully integrated, quality, well-placed assets at the bottom of the market, when we thought we could add real value in the long-term. This is a good example of one of our growth."", ""Another good example of growth is in our potash business, our Esterhazy K3 mine. We're here where we're building a new mine, which will be a highly automated modern state-of--the-art mining operation which will significantly improve our cost position and eliminate our brine inflow costs that we're now having to incur."", ""On the innovative front and product portfolio, our MicroEssentials and Aspire are very successful high value products and for Mosaic, the demand continues to grow. Now these products they add real value to the farmer and they add extra profit for both us and our distributor customers. So from that perspective, they're very successful products and for that reason they really do grow. So whether it's acquisitions, organic growth or new products, Mosaic is constantly working on ways to grow value in this company beyond just the day to day. Though our vision was clear and we're demonstrating that across the enterprise we can deliver the performance necessary to drive great results."", ""Let me just give a couple of examples of that. In addition to setting new safety and environmental records which we have for the last five years each year has been better than the year before and we continue to go on that. We've transformed each of our three businesses. We have fundamentally looked at the portfolio of assets, the cost structures and really transformed them from the top down. Our costs are down and very well controlled today. We are operating at a higher level of efficiency and really optimizing our operations."", ""Our premium products continue to grow and really lead the market, we are the leading provider of high-quality premium fertilizers. And we've successfully integrated the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition and are exceeding our synergy targets there. And as earlier mentioned, we're near completion of our Esterhazy K3 mine which will be amongst the most efficient underground potash mines in the world. And because of the operating performance we have met our leverage targets well ahead of our original expectations."", ""Today Mosaic is larger, stronger, safer and more efficient company than it has been at any time in its past. We are the world's largest phosphate producer and the largest combined phosphate and potash producer in the world. And per our previous strategies we have become an Americas powerhouse. And we also have access to all the key agricultural areas of the world. And it's important to understand that this improved position didn't come by chance. It was a very deliberate set of actions that we have taken to really turn our vision into results."", ""So with that as a backdrop, let me just talk a little bit about where we're going into the future and how our strategy will deliver superior results for the long-term."", 'We would start with finance. Our solid operational performance and results are generating strong cash flow and our financial strategy is designed to take a disciplined approach to this. Our first stop is always to make sure our balance sheet is strong and solid, maintain our financial strength and flexibility that can one sustain our asset. We are a capital intensive business. We must maintain those assets for the long-term. And the remaining capital or the remaining money, however, we have a decision which we have to make, which is what drives the most value for the company in the long term? And so those what are the investments that might drive organic growth, an important one.', 'Opportunities and strategic investments that give above capital risk rated return. And then, the third of course is returning money to shareholders. And I do believe there needs to be a good balance of returning money to shareholders both in the form of dividends and dividend growth as well as returning capital through other actions such as share buybacks.', ""As we look to our future though, one thing I will say is our core phosphate and potash business, I can't imagine a time where they won't be critical to who Mosaic is. This means we have to continue to deliver exceptional execution in those businesses. We have to increase efficiency and constantly look at how we move improved performance. We have to drive sales and margin growth over time and we have to mitigate all the risks that could harm either the environment or our people."", 'To help accomplish this, we intend to fully harness the benefit of innovative processes and technologies. These will improve our core structure and our cost structure of our performance, and, of course, the reliability of our business.', 'Some examples here that are already in the works are and you can see them in the picture. Our automated miner at K3; as we build up K3 as I say it will be one of the most automated mines going. Today we have been working on fully automating our miners which will allow us to operate manless, but also improve efficiency, productivity and safety for our people underground.', ""Likewise our remote central operations in Florida shown in the other picture allows us to operate much of our open pit and drag lime mines from a central control room miles away from the actual mining operation. This again is improving uptime; it's improving asset utilization and productivity."", ""And we haven't stopped at those. We're also looking at our back office costs and automating those. Our shared services centers in both Brazil and North America are highly automated allowing us to become much more efficient as how we do the routine tasks of administration and how we reduce SG&A costs."", ""But, in addition to ensuring our core businesses are highly competitive in position to win. We also look at how we continue to grow value by expanding the overall view of how we see Mosaic. And in this, Mosaic's leadership team and I, we've been tasked ourselves with finding, evaluating and pursuing what are the most compelling opportunities within our core businesses, but also in the adjacencies to those businesses."", ""Here it's important to note that the central idea any potential future move has to be something that builds on and leverages our current assets and capabilities. So we're very focused on how to conservatively add growth opportunities from where we are today."", ""So to summarize we are realizing our vision, we're performing and executing on a very high level of efficiency and delivering the results. Now I see my role as CEO is ensuring that we take the right short-term strategic steps to ensure the long-term vision is achieved and to make sure on the long-term we can add superior shareholder value."", ""We're effectively managing all aspects of the business that are within our control. And I believe we are pushing the right levers to ensure we succeed, because of this, I believe we are very well positioned to exceed expectations for many years to come."", ""I'm very energized by Mosaic and where it is today, where our markets are today and I really think we have a great future, if you look out for the next five to 10 years."", ""So with that, I'd like to say thank you for listening and I think I'll go back for some questions.

So while the trade war is certainly going to affect U.S. farmers, it creates an opportunity for Brazilian farmers. So from our perspective today we're seeing beans with $1 local premium in Brazil, we've got a weak Brazilian reais. And so the Brazilian farmer is doing very well and we're seeing growth in our business in Brazil because of that."", ""And so in some respects if you look at it from an international perspective, China will get their grains and oilseeds and it's just a matter of where those come from as opposed to whether they will come.

So in that backdrop and beans being behind as well and in the backdrop it's pretty hard to say what is weather and what is trade war.

And this year one would have expected that to be over in March, April and the extra inventory would start to clear out and then prices start to rise. That hasn't happened this year in North America. And while that's only at North America is, let's say 10 million tons of a total 70 some million ton market, it has an impact on the rest, because it pushes everything back around the globe. So this year phosphate has been weak largely driven by U.S. And I will say driven by also the flooding in the Mississippi. So you have capped a product, which just can't get to any market right now and so that is creating pressure on traders and whatnot to try and liquidate."", ""So what will happen? We've had a bad fall followed by a bad spring in North America. Assuming that most of the fertilizer gets down this spring, so it becomes a volume issue and becomes a price issue not just the volume -- not a volume issue. But, if that comes past which we still expect it does come to pass that let's say 95% of the market tends to happen in the year. We expect a very robust and strong fall because now you have, in today's world where almost everybody at least all professional farmers are constantly evaluating what their land looks like from a nutrient perspective, and then applying fertilizer by formulas. We expect people will come back and the fall application will be very robust particularly on areas where they haven't been able to plant because they're going to be available earlier. So you're going to have a long opportunity this fall."", ""In terms of the rest of the world, China demand is down. We're not completely sure whether that is policy or whether that is some impact of swine fever and not having to feed the -- not having to grow the grain to feed the swine herd, if you will. But those all sort of take care of themselves over time. And one thing, I will say about China is, their pollution issues are real. Their EPA is absolutely focused on addressing water pollution area issues so they will produce less phosphates over time. I mean that is a given.

If anything the yields of grain and oilseeds in China is declining and is declining because they're under fertilizing at this stage I believe. So, if they're going to meet the central planning government of China has a real challenge. On one hand they want to increase yields, on the other hand they want to reduce pollution and they also have to feed a growing population and they've got to throw a trade war to deal with. So what are they going to do? I think they have to increase productivity of their farming which means they have to consolidate some of these very small farms and they have to start using fertilizer efficiently and properly to improve yields."", ""And so I think long-term -- I think we are at a bottom for at least phosphate use. Potash continues to go up in use in China. So I think they're getting closer to a better balance between the two. But I think from here I think they both have to go up a little bit to improve yields.

1215,Joc O’Rourke,"[""I think the Chinese uncertainty is something that just has to play out in its time. I mean I like to say it's going to play out and I think it's given that it plays out. If you think about the air pollution, any of you have been to either Beijing or Shanghai in the last year. Last time I was in Beijing where -- we were in Beijing. You couldn't see across the street. But clearly air pollution is the first one they have to deal with. But water pollution on the Yangtze river is likely just as big a deal for China. And so they're going to have to 70% of the mined rock in China, phosphate rock mined in China is mined in the catchment area of that Yangtze river, but they've got to address pollution along the Yangtze. And that means they're going to have to look at taking reducing the number of sort of mom and pop shop phosphate producers that are highly polluting and focus on the efficient environmentally better plans.""]",question_answer,MOS_153306

1217,Joc O’Rourke,"['I think it\'s -- let\'s start with industry structure. You have five players that basically 75% of the product. I think each of those players understands that there is more value in maintaining a steady market than there is and you\'re fighting for that last ton of sales, if you will. And so from that perspective and we just saw it in Indonesia, I think where the bids or the bids opened were 330, so that\'s a good table price for Indonesia. And I think what 360, 358 in Bangladesh. So again, you\'re looking at -- the bid numbers are coming in saying, ""Hey, we really don\'t think this should be any lower than where it is today."" And that\'s been consistent. Well, I think that helps the market.']",question_answer,MOS_153306

1219,Joc O’Rourke,"[""Again, this is the opening of the tender. We don't know if that'll be the final price or anything, so just to be clear on that. But, the China contract today and for those of you who aren't well aware of it, it's a benchmark. But, it is becoming probably less and less relevant in terms of the big picture of global trade in potash. But, I would say today neither the supplier or the consumer has more power in that. It's a balanced market. The suppliers are well-disciplined, but there's no question the Chinese buyers are well-disciplined as well. So I don't see a strong benefit to either one. So I think you're looking at maybe a minor improvement in price or a minor increase in price or flat or something like that, but not a big move. There's not the dislocation of value of this.""]",question_answer,MOS_153306

And what that means is, we can move the shutting down of K1 and K2 and the elimination of brine back one year from 2024 to 2023. But in between there is a steady ramp up. Today, we have -- the mine is running, we're building underground infrastructure. We have a proper conveyance to bring the rocks or skip to bring the rock to surface. We have a conveyer from K3 to K2. We're building another conveyor from K3 to K1 and we will ramp up probably at a rate of about a half a million product tons a year for the next three or four years and then we'll be running -- then we'll end up having the development done to run that full speed by 2023.

Now, you still need maintenance, you still need where you might move from operators to instrument techs and maintenance people. But, the big benefit there is not necessarily the reduction of people, it's moving people away from the mining phase where they were exposed to risks and whatnot from both the equipment and the mine itself. But also, it allows us to run through lunch breaks or shift changes and whatnot. So, the productivity improvement is where -- a lot of the benefit really comes from that.

But, what we're seeing at the same time is they've shut down their Sigmundshall mine and they're probably running a little less out of some of their other German mines like Werra. And so, overall, we haven't seen a big impact of new output from K+S. So, that's the first one. The next competitor Uralkali, I'll come back to EuroChem in a second. Well, I'll hit them at the same time."", ""If you look at exports from Russia they seem to be relatively flat, which would tell me that EuroChem's ramp up is probably being offset by a decline in likely Uralkali's output. Now, again, there's been nothing official. We do know that Uralkali's Solikamsk-2 mine has had water inflow issues and probably has had restricted production and that seems to be more than offsetting probably what's been the ramp up of EuroChem."", ""In EuroChem, they have two mines ramping up. Our understanding is that VolgaKaliy on the Volga River is ramping up rather slowly if at all. And then, their Usolskiy mine in the Perm Region is probably ramping up at about expectations or something like that.

So, I think we were the better owner, but also how well that integrated with our own distribution business and some of the benefit we got there probably surprised me. And I think some of the price realization we've been able to get because of not being -- having our people who are better marketers market that product has been a benefit. Doesn't show up on synergies, but it certainly shows up in price realization.

1266,Joc O’Rourke,"['Thank you, Laura, and good morning to you all. Mosaic delivered another solid quarter despite significantly lower phosphate prices and operating rates driven by weather conditions in North America as well as regulatory changes in Brazil.', 'Despite the challenging conditions, we continue to execute at a very high level across the company, which is reflected in well-controlled operating costs and continued increases in synergy realization at Mosaic Fertilizantes.', 'Our results demonstrate the economic value of the much more efficient business that we have created. Before we get into the results for the quarter, I would like to provide you with an update on the situation in Brazil, where the new regulation governing mine tailings dam is having an impact on our operations.', 'Since the Vale dam failure, Brumadinho, in January we have been working with our external consultants and the Brazilian regulators to ensure our own dams remain safe to operate and meet the newly implemented standards. In March, we recognized that our dam at Araxa did not meet the new requirement and idled that mine. In-mid April we were unable to complete geo technical assessments at an additional three dams resulting in the idling of our Tapira and Catalao mines.', 'Now that the assessments are complete, we have a much better understanding of the timing and implications related to idling of these mines. At Catalao we expect to be fully operational in the second quarter. At Tapira, we expect to return to full operation in the third quarter.', 'At Araxa, we are on track to begin operations in the third quarter. While these mines are idled, we expect to meet our Brazilian customers fertilizer needs with a combination of existing rock and production inventory in Brazil, rock from our mine in Peru and MAP from Florida.', 'For the year we expect to incur higher rock costs from importing rock from our Peru mine primarily from higher transportation costs and additional cost from under utilization at the mines and chemical plants. Combined we expect these incremental costs could total up to $100 million.', 'We are continuing to look for ways to further mitigate these higher costs. We also expect some positive offsets, for example, higher operating rates at our lower cost Florida assets should lead to stronger margins. We anticipate the work to bring all dams into compliance and remediate the remaining upstream list will be accomplished within our existing capital budget over the next three years.', 'Our ability to use Miski Mayo rock in our global production demonstrates the strategic and risk management benefits of owning three quarters of this mine. In addition, we expect that these incremental shipments may allow the mine to operate at higher rates, driving lower cost per tonne.', 'Shipping MAP from Florida to Brazil will allow us to consume built-up us inventory more quickly. Going into North American spring season both Mosaic’s and channel inventories were high due to the weak 2018 fall application season and the late and wet 2019 spring. Reducing our own inventories while the spring season is depleting channel inventories should result in a tightening of supply.', ""To summarize our efforts related to dams in Brazil. We have a well defined plan to resolve the issue. We are taking action and making good progress towards resolution. We are meeting our customer needs and we'll continue to do so reflecting the benefit of our global asset footprint and combination of distribution and production."", 'And finally, we believe that in the end Mosaic will have a lower risk profile and remain in an excellent position to serve resilient agricultural markets for generations to come.', ""Now let's move on to the quarter results. We provided substantial updates on our progress at our Analyst Day at the end of March. So, we will keep our remarks brief. For the quarter, Mosaic reported earnings of $131 million, up from $42 million last year, both on revenues of $1.9 billion."", ""The company generated $430 million of adjusted EBITDA compared to $399 million of adjusted EBITDA a year ago and adjusted earnings per share of $0.25 compared with $0.20 a year ago. The improvement in operating margin despite a lower phosphate stripping margin and the impact of curtailments reflects the underlying improvements we've made in our cost structure."", 'Based on our actual results for the first quarter and our outlook, we are revising our full year EBITDA guidance to $2 billion to $2.3 billion from $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion. This reflects the impact of the regulation change in Brazil, but also acknowledges the impact of higher Canadian resource taxes and slower phosphate pricing recovery than originally anticipated.', 'Moving on to the business environment, markets for our two nutrients diverged during the first quarter. As I said earlier, phosphate prices fell primarily as a result of high carryover inventories in North America and high and early seasonal imports into New Orleans.', 'In addition, Chinese exports in the first quarter increased by over 0.5 million tonnes from a year ago adding to global market length while lower raw material prices helped, market stripping margins still declined over 20% year-over-year.', 'North American demand began to emerge at the quarters end and prices have stabilized. In fact, prices have actually increased for product that is upcountry in the U.S. where high Mississippi River water levels have created logistic challenges.', 'Mosaic has a strong geographic competitive advantage in the U.S. over importers. At the end of the quarter, over 40% of our phosphate inventory was in upcountry facility of St. Louis in Mosaic’s or our customers warehouses, which gives us the ability to get product where it needs to be regardless of river shipping conditions.', 'This also highlights why we recently purchased a very large distribution facility called Pine Bend near the north end of the Mississippi River in Minnesota. The facility significantly improves our ability to serve Midwest customers and reduces our logistics risks.', ""In addition, we're finally seeing seasonal demand in China emerge which is focusing Chinese production on domestic demand. On the other side of the world fertilizer demand in Brazil is running ahead of last year with very strong shipment growth in both phosphates and potash."", 'In contrast to the phosphate market potash was much less impacted by the logistic challenges in the Mississippi River region. And the potash supply and demand picture remained balanced during the quarter with prices holding relatively flat.', 'Our curtailments in the quarter were driven by logistics issues internationally and full warehouses domestically. Those issues are now resolved and we expect inventory to flow out in the second quarter with much less logistical friction.', 'In addition, we continue to expect constructive market fundamentals for potash through at least 2020. We acknowledged that there are risks to our outlook including whether such as the El Nino related drought that may impact potash demand in Southeast Asia and palm oil demand uncertainty, in phosphates the Chinese supply and demand picture continues to search for a new normal.', 'The continued strength of demand in our markets combined with our strong execution gives us confidence that we can weather the short-term challenges and come out even stronger in the end.', 'Now Clint will discuss the segments in more detail including our expectations for the second quarter. Flint?']",management_discussion,MOS_151531
1267,Clint Freeland,"[""Thanks Joc. Good morning everyone. I'll start by reiterating Joc's message regarding the first quarter. Our business performed well as a result of excellent execution across the business units, and we delivered results in line with our expectations despite the weather and regulatory factors Joc discussed. Our Potash business generated another strong quarter with shipments in gross margin per tonne coming at the high end of our expectations."", 'Our cash costs of managing brine inflow declined to $28 million in the quarter and overall costs remained well controlled. We curtailed production at our Canadian mines during the quarter due to high inventory levels at the plants, which resulted from severe winter weather and slow rail service. As a result, our operating rate declined to 86%, which not only let us to recording approximately $11 million in idle plant costs during the first quarter, but also having higher cost production roll into inventory, which will be realized during the second quarter.', ""Last year, we changed our revenue recognition policy and there's now a longer lag between Canpotex shipment and revenue recognition. Fewer tonnes leaving the mines in the first quarter will negatively impact Canpotex volumes, but we expect this to be offset by strong domestic sales during the quarter."", 'With these dynamics in mind, our expectations for the second quarter are for sales volumes of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes and adjusted gross margin per tonne in the range of $70 to $80. As previously disclosed, we expect our cost of doing business in Canada to increase from where they have been in the past. As a result of higher taxes, we expect the Saskatchewan resource tax increase to raise our cost of goods sold by approximately $35 million in 2019 and by roughly $50 million per year thereafter.', 'Our phosphates results for the quarter reflected the deeper-than-usual seasonal price reductions and a continued delay in price recovery. While we recognize sales of 1.8 million tonnes, which was near the top end of our guidance range, we ended the quarter with over 1.3 million tonnes of finished product inventory. We expect to liquidate this inventory as we meet our North American and Brazilian customer needs, which should allow us to maintain high operating rates and low conversion costs.', 'We earned adjusted gross margin per tonne of $36 during the first quarter, slightly below our expectations due to lower market prices and the impact of higher cost associated with the accelerated maintenance work done in the quarter. We announced this shift to curtail production by 300,000 tonnes during the quarter because of temporary market conditions. Similar to the fourth quarter of last year, rock costs during the period were somewhat elevated as we transition to new mining areas. This is short-term, however and does not change any of the longer term targets that we outlined at our Analyst Day.', 'Cash conversion costs continue to be well managed. During the second quarter, we expect to sell 2.3 to 2.6 million tonnes of finished product reflecting strong North American and Brazilian seasonal demand. Our gross margin per tonne expectation is $40 to $50 and includes the impact of the higher rock cost I mentioned running through inventory.', 'Recent ammonia and sulfur price declines are expected to flow through cost of goods sold likely in the third quarter. Our MicroEssentials products continued to perform well during the quarter with gross margin premiums of $62 per tonne over MAP. We expect this to remain in the $40 to $50 per tonne range for the year. In Brazil, fertilizer demand remains robust. Gross margin per tonne in the first quarter was lower than expected due to the cost of idling Araxa and other costs related to the new regulations.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes realized net synergies of $66 million ahead of the $47 million that we shared during our Analyst Day presentation. All-in-all, business fundamentals, production, sales and synergy capture remained very strong in the quarter. Even with the current challenges, we believe that we will achieve our targeted net synergies of $275 million in 2019.', 'As Joc noted earlier, we expect it to incur up to $100 million in incremental costs during 2019, as we managed through the dam issue in Brazil. As part of our mitigation plan, we intend to import up to 120,000 tonnes of Miski Mayo rock monthly at an incremental logistics cost of $60 per tonne of rock. This covers about 40% of our total monthly rock used at the Brazilian plants. In over six months, this would add about $40 million to our costs in 2019.', 'Even with imported rock and existing rock inventories, we still expect to operate our chemical plants below full capacity resulting in higher period cost and cost per tonne of finished product. And finally, we plan to import up to 300,000 tonnes of finished product from Florida. However, I would note that the lower cost of production in Florida offsets a meaningful portion of the incremental transportation costs.', ""Taken together, these items are expected to increase the segment’s operating costs by up to $100 million in 2019, approximately $50 million in the second quarter alone. For the second quarter, we expect sales volumes of 2 million to 2.3 million tonnes in line with normal expectations. As part of our plan to meet our customer needs, we've already begun to modify our current contracts to be optional origin, which allows us to source product from any of our global facilities, be it from North America, Brazil, or Saudi Arabia to serve our customers."", 'Gross margin per tonne is expected to be within range of $15 to $25, reflecting the impact of the higher costs that I mentioned, partially offset by distribution margins on the imported tonnes. At our recent Analyst Day, we outlined 2021 targets for each of our business units and we will continue to mark our progress toward them. This slide shows the four quarter rolling average as of the first quarter. Averages are meant to smooth out seasonality and the impact of turnarounds.', ""In addition, we've provided you our starting point, the 2018 actuals. While we work through the regulatory changes in Brazil, we do not expect to be making progress on the Mosaic Fertilizantes targets. The only other metric that is pressured near-term is the cash cost of rock and phosphates where we've had a couple of quarters of higher costs as we transition to new mining areas."", ""As we've discussed in the past, our business is seasonal, which means our working capital and cash flow is as well. The first quarter of each year tends to see the greatest use of working capital as inventory builds for spring application season and certain accruals from the previous year are extinguished."", 'This year was no different, as inventories rose by approximately $300 million and almost $200 million in payables related to Canadian taxes and G&A accruals were paid. As we move forward in the year, however, we would expect working capital to return to more normal levels.', ""As noted earlier, we're updating our guidance ranges for the year as a result of incremental cost in Brazil, higher tax burden in Canada and slower than expected phosphate recovery. Adjusted EBITDA is now expected to be in the range of $2.0 billion to $2.3 billion and adjusted earnings per share is now $1.50 to $2, reflecting an expected increase in the effective tax rate."", 'Regarding cash usage, there are a handful of items to note. First, cash tax estimates have increased by almost $15 million on higher Canadian earnings and withholding. Cash interest expense estimates are up $10 million, due to a combination of lower cash balances and higher working capital financing cost in Brazil.', ""And finally, we've allocated $55 million during the quarter to the acquisition of the Pine Bend Warehouse, which financially generates an after tax unlevered return in the mid-teens and strategically positions us to better serve our customers by having increased Midwest warehousing capacity."", ""This acquisition lowers our logistics risk and allows us to take advantage of time and place premiums like we're seeing today. This acquisition also allowed us to avoid significant future CapEx spend at our Savage facility. Based on these factors, we expect capital available for allocation to be in the range of $400 million to $700 million for the year."", ""Now I'll turn the call back to Joc for his closing comments.""]",management_discussion,MOS_151531

So you would have a noncash write-off of that to the extent that you permanently closed the facility."", 'And then the other thing that you would have would be an increase in the ARO, the asset retirement obligation related to that facility.

But bear in mind that Q1 is a relatively low volume quarter for exports. It makes up usually 10% to 15% of annual exports. What we've seen from a rock costs standpoint is that rock production was down in 2018 via the official statistics 22% year-over-year. We understand that they had depleted domestic inventories to maintain their downstream production relatively flat."", ""But that will be putting upward pressure on costs as we move through 2019, we'd also expect to see sulfur prices on the rise. We've seen continued relatively high ammonia costs. So there won't be this upward pressure supporting the price floor in China. And because of that we would expect to see volumes as we move throughout the course of 2019 begin to taper off. And also supporting that is just the emptiness of their domestic channel. So they robbed their domestic channel of tonnes in order to export in Q4 as well as in Q1.

As Joc mentioned, the yields, grain and oilseed yields in China have plateaued and we don't think that that's a sustainable situation for the government there.

I guess we'd start out to say that there are a lot of unknowns still, and we're watching and monitoring, but we don't have all the answers quite yet. What we do know is that Chinese pork production will certainly be down significantly both this year and probably into next year as well."", ""Following that feed demand will obviously decline as well. And it could be significant enough that it would erase typical annual global growth in grain and oilseed demand. So, if you look at corn being about 1.1 billion tonnes, soybeans about a third of that 350 million tonnes. So taken together at 2% typical annual growth rate, you're talking a little over 30 million tonnes of grain and oilseed demand that could be lost."", ""There will be offsets. So the U.S. industry, the Brazilian industry, the European pork industry, they're all setting up to produce more pork and export to China. So, there will be increased feed consumption in those geographies."", 'And then just to put it into some context, if you look at the E10 program that China is set to roll out, the incremental demand from Corn for an E10 program in China would be in excess of that 30 million to 32 million tonnes of feed demand that would be lost. So, there are a lot of potential offsets out there that we continue to monitor as well.']",question_answer,MOS_151531

We accomplished a great deal in 2018. We transformed the business in Brazil, improved our cost base in Phosphates, made major strides toward completing our Esterhazy K3 potash mine, delivered record potash production, and reached a new milestone in premium product sales.', ""All these accomplishments allowed us to capture the full benefit of improving market conditions. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we've made and we're optimistic regarding 2019. Our announcement today that we will double our annual dividend target reflects our first step toward increasing capital returns to shareholders."", 'For the fourth quarter, Mosaic reported earnings of $0.29 per share and adjusted earnings per share of $0.77 per share, which represents over a 100% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2017.', 'Adjusted earnings for the quarter include a $21 million benefit, approximately $0.05 per share from the reduction of the full year estimated tax rate for 2018. Net sales increased by $429 million to $2.5 billion over a year ago.', 'Our full-year 2018 results reflect positive market dynamics and solid execution across the business. For the year, revenues increased by 29% to $9.6 billion. We reported net earnings of $470 million and adjusted EBITDA of $2 billion, a 68% increase over a year ago.', 'Net earnings per share were $1.22 compared to a loss in 2017. And adjusted earnings per share increased over 90% to $2.12 per share.', 'I would like to provide some detail on our 2018 accomplishments. We successfully integrated and substantially transformed the Vale Fertilizantes business. in fact Mosaic Fertilizantes delivered $227 million in operating earnings and $410 million in adjusted EBITDA in the year, compared with pro forma adjusted EBITDA of $81 million in 2017.', 'One of the primary factors driving this turnaround is the pace at which the team in Brazil is realizing synergies. We realized $158 million of net synergies in 2018, with a run-rate exceeding $280 million at year-end. We now expect to reach our net synergy target in 2019, a full year ahead of schedule.', 'The Potash team delivered record production for both the quarter and the full year. We made major progress on the new Esterhazy K3 project, including the recent commissioning of the first production hoist and conveyor to the K2 mill. Our engineers have developed a path to accelerate development at K3 by a full year and now we expect to be able to eliminate brine management costs entirely by 2024.', 'In Phosphates, the transformation of the business is delivering meaningful financial and operational benefits as well as creating significant savings and deferral of capital spending, without sacrificing safety, mechanical integrity or reserve life.', 'We shipped a record 3 million tonnes of MicroEssentials including over 1 million tonnes to Brazil. Our sales of MicroEssentials continues to grow. In fact, companywide, our sales have grown at a compound rate of 18% over the past 10 years and Brazil sales have grown even faster with a compound annual rate of 41% albeit from a smaller base. We expect to add capacity through debottlenecking and potential additional facility conversions as demand continues to grow.', ""We announced another important milestone during the fourth quarter. We received the final permit for our Ona mine site. The mine gives us access to a large reserve and helps to extend Florida Phosphate mining for decades to come. We plan to mine these reserves with existing assets, including the South Pasture facility, minimizing the need for new capital spending and highlighting one of the primary benefits of our acquisition of CF Industries' phosphate business."", 'Finally, and perhaps most importantly, we generated another year of record safety performance. Even as we push to reduce cost and integrate our largest acquisition ever, all of us at Mosaic are proud of the trajectory of our safety performance, steady improvement year-by-year for the past eight years.', 'Overall, 2018 was a year of remarkable progress and strong results and we expect to realize further benefit from our strategic successes and good markets in 2019. We expect global supply and demand to remain balanced for both phosphates and potash in the year ahead. While the channel appears to be well stocked around the world, in part due to a weak fall application season in North America, we expect inventories to be draw down quickly and strong demand to emerge as we move through North American spring and as the season picks up in Brazil. New supply in both phosphates and potash has been slow to come to market and that trend is continuing in 2019.', 'This slow global supply ramp-up has allowed demand to catch up and keep potash and phosphate markets balanced. We continue to watch political and trade developments around the world as well as Chinese phosphate exports, which we believe will continue to follow the economics.', 'Now I will turn the call over to Clint to discuss our segments, capital, and our guidance for the first quarter and for the year.']",management_discussion,MOS_147546
1340,Clint Freeland,"['Thank you. Joc. Good morning, everyone.', 'As noted earlier, Mosaic finished the year with a strong fourth quarter generating $590 million in adjusted EBITDA and $0.77 a share in adjusted earnings per share, bringing full-year adjusted EBITDA to $2.029 billion and adjusted earnings per share to $2.12, both of which exceeded the top end of our guidance ranges. All three business units performed well and contributed to this outcome.', ""And Mosaic Fertilizantes' adjusted EBITDA for the quarter totaled $133 million compared to pro forma fourth quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA of $13 million as the business continued to benefit from strong selling prices, synergy realizations, wider distribution margins and favorable foreign exchange rates."", 'Gross margin per tonne for the business during the quarter was $56, well above the top end of our expected range of $35 to $45 as the distribution business not only exceeded sales expectations, but delivered a higher margin mix of sales during the quarter, in part due to high MicroEssentials sales volumes.', 'As demonstrated in the results, the team in Brazil has made great progress and its synergy capture program. In addition to the $158 million in net realized synergies noted earlier, Mosaic Fertilizantes realized an additional $21 million in benefits from executing its business-to-business marketing strategy, which allowed us to keep our selling prices at or above replacement costs.', 'As revenue synergies were not included when we set our original synergy targets and ranges, we wanted to remain consistent in our reporting and note them separately. But make no mistake, these benefits are real and they are contributing to the financial results of the business.', 'Similar to Mosaic Fertilizantes, the Phosphates segment delivered a very strong fourth quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $219 million versus $182 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. While sale volumes were down compared to last year as a result of the Plant City idling, results improved as higher average stripping margins offset the sales decline.', 'Gross margin per tonne for the Phosphates segment totaled $81, comfortably exceeding our guidance. These higher margins were driven primarily by product mix. We sold more product to higher netback regions and a higher proportion of premium MicroEssentials products than we originally forecasted. Margins also benefited from several relatively small normal course but infrequent items that together added approximately $5 a tonne during the quarter.', 'The Potash segment also generated strong results for the quarter with adjusted EBITDA of $256 million compared to $155 million in the same quarter last year as higher market prices and continued cost management efforts led to the improvement. Of note, during the quarter was the extraordinary operational performance of the potash fleet, which recorded a 99% operating rate during the period.', ""The Company continues to focus on managing costs and has made tremendous progress when measured by SG&A per tonne. To further enhance our focus in this area and better align reporting cost with accountability and decision-making, we've determined that certain corporate costs that are not controllable by the business should no longer be allocated to the operating segments and should instead be reported in the Corporate segment."", ""Not only should this increase visibility and improve accountability for managing these costs, but it should also give investors a clearer view of true segment level cost and margins. We will make this reporting change beginning in the first quarter and we'll recast prior quarters and updated performance data that we'll post to our website before our next earnings."", 'Before moving on to our expectations for 2019, there is one more financial reporting topic, I would like to comment on. As noted in our press release, we completed our year-end close process which went relatively smoothly.', 'However, because of the size and complexities of the purchase accounting related to our acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes, which included 54,000 assets, we are continuing to work on the allocation of value, the documentation related to that allocation process, and our evaluation of internal control effectiveness.', ""Since we need additional time to complete this work, we will file a Form 12 b-25, which would allow us an additional 15 days to file our 2018 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon filing within the prescribed deadline, the Company's Form 10-K will be deemed to be timely filed. We do not expect that the results reported to you today will differ in any material respect from those presented in our 2018 Form 10-K."", 'Our outlook for full-year 2019 reflects our expectation for continued strength in our core markets and progress on the various transformation efforts around the Company. As reflected on Slide 11 of the presentation, we are initiating our full-year 2019 guidance with an adjusted EBITDA range of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, and an adjusted earnings per share range of $2.10 to $2.50.', ""There are many assumptions that have gone into our estimates, some of which we've outlined on Slide 14 in the appendix of this presentation. There are a few others that I would note. First, finished product and raw material product pricing expectations are based on visible and anticipated prices as of mid-February."", 'Second, as Joc noted earlier, we expect to achieve our full synergy target in 2019. So we have included $275 million in net synergies in our guidance. Turning to K3, the commissioning of the first hoist and conveyor at the site means that the mine is now being accounted for as a production facility.', 'As a result, some costs of underground development are no longer capitalized but are being added to operating cost. These costs total $25 million to $30 million in 2019. Given the relatively modest incremental tonnage being produced in this development phase, we expect our production cost per tonne for the business segment to be approximately $3 per tonne higher than it otherwise would be. This is transient however, and is expected to be de minimis by 2021.', 'Next, based on a comprehensive peer review comparing our definition of adjusted EBITDA to those used by both competitors and others more broadly, we have decided to update our definition to exclude both non-cash ARO accretion expense and equity settled incentive compensation beginning January 1st 2019.', 'Our guidance for 2019 includes an estimated $60 million benefit from this change. For comparative purposes, the historical performance data will be republished to reflect this change as well as the SG&A allocation change I mentioned earlier.', 'And finally, as is normal in our business, we expect to see a degree of seasonality in our business this year with more modest earnings in the first quarter and more robust earnings in the second, third and fourth quarters. With the weak fall application season and the impact that has had on phosphate inventory channels and finished product prices, we expect a more pronounced seasonal effect on earnings in this first quarter than in prior years.', ""While we've also seen a reduction in raw material prices, which should provide an offsetting benefit, this is expected to take one to two quarters to be realized through our cost of goods sold, ultimately benefiting results in future quarters."", 'With adjusted EBITDA of $2.2 billion to $2.4 billion, the Company expects to generate significant cash flow in 2019. Cash interest expense is estimated at approximately $160 million, and we anticipate paying roughly $60 million in cash taxes, primarily in Brazil and Canada. Sustaining CapEx is targeted at $720 million and is in line with historic guidance of $500 million to $600 million per year for the phosphate and potash businesses and approximately $150 million for Mosaic Fertilizantes. Longer term, we would expect consolidated sustaining capital to remain consistent with these historic ranges at around $650 million to $750 million annually.', 'Assuming that working capital nets out over the course of the year, the Company should have $1.26 billion to $1.46 billion in allocable cash during 2019. Current capital allocation commitments to-date include, first, the stock common stock dividend, which we are targeting at $0.20 a share, up from $0.10 per share.', ""Second, K3 Mine development and acceleration. It's important to note here that the capital budget for the mine remains unchanged, but that annual spend has increased due to the accelerated schedule. In addition, these numbers include increasing compaction capacity to allow us to achieve higher margins from our production."", 'Third, Florida mine life extension projects that will not only extend the resource life for our phosphate business, but will also allow us to avoid over $1 billion in future capital spend previously thought necessary.', 'Fourth, approximately $50 million in low-risk, high-return organic investments, 70% of which pay for themselves within two years. In total, $560 million in capital has been allocated to these items, leaving $700 million to $900 million in cash available to be allocated this year.', ""With that said, it's important to note that the vast majority of this cash will be generated in the second half of this year given the seasonality of the business and that we would anticipate being somewhat measured in our capital deployment in the near term as we monitor developments in Brazil with respect to the recently passed new rules and regulations and assess how they may affect us."", ""And as we've said in the past, our objective is to execute a balanced capital allocation program that promotes the growth and resiliency of the business through continued strengthening of the balance sheet, investments in projects that generate appropriate risk-adjusted returns and provides a regular return of capital to shareholders."", ""With that, I'll ask Joc for his closing comments.""]",management_discussion,MOS_147546

In light of the new regulations and after conferring with independent experts, we believe that 21 of our 22 structures are compliant with the new safety regulations, although, two of these dams have upstream lifts that require remediation plans.', 'One tailings dam at our Araxa facility does not appear to meet the new safety standard for undrained resistance. While the dam was in compliance under the old criteria, we had already been making improvements to the dam to increase our margin of safety.', ""We proactively reported the potential issue to the ANM, the agency that regulates dams in Brazil, and after consultation with the ANM, we've agreed to keep the line out of operation until we can improve the dam's undrained safety factor."", 'All of our other 21 structures have current certificates of stability issued by external consultants. In addition, the Company has arranged for an independent third-party assessment of all of our dams, which is expected to be complete in approximately 90 days.', 'I would also note that none of our tailings dams utilize the upstream method of construction that was apparently used in the construction of dams that failed in the Samarco and Feijao incidents. We have two dams at our center line construction, but have small final upstream lifts. We are assessing remediation requirements for those dams.', 'While there is uncertainty about the future requirements that the Brazilian Government may impose on miners and on tailings dams, we believe change is necessary and will only make mining in Brazil safer and more sustainable for the future.

Yeah, if you look at Chinese phosphate shipments of the high analysis products that they peaked a few years ago at about 22 million tonnes, I believe. They are down closer to 16 million tonnes."", ""So we've had a real significant decline in Chinese phosphate shipments and I think the 22 million tonnes was inflated by the fact that there were concerns going back a few years about the security of supply and then whatnot and they did build some strategic reserves in their system and pipeline inventories or channel inventories were very high. They have worked those down."", ""In fact, we think - we think the channel in China is pretty much completely empty at this point given the deferral that has taken place and we think that 16 million tonne mark that we're forecasting this year is kind of the structural, you know, the correct level and while China is trying to reduce or keep flat their overall nutrient use, we do think there's some substitution of low analysis and the K products and single superphosphates, fused magnesium phosphate that are being produced by these very small plants where there, you know, phosphate mine has been shut down for environmental reasons and so forth."", 'So we do think that even though phosphate use may stabilize or even go down a little bit, we do think the high analysis products will continue to be shipped at a rate of about 16 million metric tonnes per year.

We will be making forward-looking statements. The other thing we're now highlighting is we do make non-GAAP estimates and so recognize that those are non-GAAP and we have to acknowledge that."", 'Done. Okay, let me start out by giving you a little bit of a top level highlights of Mosaic and let me start by saying, we are the number one global producer, combined producer of finished phosphates and potash in the world.', ""Number one in phosphates with a capacity of around 16 million tonnes globally, brought operationally by our Vale acquisition, which I'll come back to. And then potash the number four producer with a capacity today of about 11 million tonnes of capacity."", ""The other thing that I think is important to highlight for us is, we are, by a reasonable margin, the number one producer of premium fertilizer products and led by our MicroEssentials product, of course, but now more recently Aspire and I'll come back to that."", 'In terms of distribution, we have distribution assets in some of the key markets, which allow us to have access - clear access to markets that we might not have otherwise had, including India, China and Brazil. But we overall distribute to 40 countries around the world, including a number of countries where we distribute potash through our global marketing company, which is a partnership with Nutrien, the Canpotex corporation, so that services both us and Nutrien.', 'So very international, probably I would say of the fertilizer producers, the most international of them, but also the most ag-centric of the fertilizer companies.', ""As a company, while we're very global though, we have focused on the Americas and the reason that is, is we believe that's where we have the biggest, if you will, home-court advantage. And here in the Americas, we've built a real, what I would call, a real powerhouse and this is important from our positioning."", 'We make 74%, 75% of all the phosphates made in North America. We have approximately 50% of that what is sold in North America from a phosphate perspective and about 40% or so of the potash market in North America and one of the two large North American potash producers, obviously.', ""Our position in Brazil equally strong. We now sell, manufacture or - and import or - and finally sell 9 million of the 35 million or so tonnes of fertilizer that's sold each year in Brazil and so that really makes us pretty powerful in both North and South America. I'll let people get a little bit more settled."", ""In terms of our strategy, we - when I came in a CEO, we developed what we've called our win and grow strategy. And I think that's an important piece that differentiates us as a company. And the reason I say that is we start out by saying the first thing for a major commodity producer is, you've got to have the cost structures, right, and we really focused in on improving our cost structures, transforming our businesses so we'd have the right opportunities to grow."", ""And since then, in a fairly challenging market environment, we've really been able to - and I'll come back to these improvements, but really been able to solidify our business and make that overall business much more competitive, so that we were prepared when the time came to make the strategic move of buying the Vale business."", ""And then equally, I think the skills that we've learnt in terms of transformation and driving cost out of businesses has been very useful in terms of how we've been able to improve the position in Vale and achieve the cost synergies we have in what we now call Mosaic Fertilizantes."", ""So if we look at that from an overall business perspective, we've now had 5 years of transforming the business. I'm going to go through this fairly quickly, but I'll come back to each of these pieces. But really what does it mean?"", ""We've made permanent cost and structural changes to our Phosphate and Potash business that allow them to be much more efficient. With the Mosaic Fertilizantes business and through the acquisition and synergy realizations we've again, strengthened that business greatly."", ""We are developing the Esterhazy K3, which will allow us to eliminate our brine inflow, but also reduce our cost in potash even further, but we haven't left it at the operations as the only place we've looked at cost. We've focused on lowering our SG&A at the same time."", 'And then on the revenue side and the business side, we’ve been greatly growing our premium product portfolio, which has allowed us to improve things on the revenue side, as well as repositioning our balance sheet and making overall a stronger company.', ""So let me come back to that in a little bit of detail. Let's start with the SG&A where if you look back to 2014-ish, sorry, 2013, our SG&A per tonne was around $20 per tonne, today it sits around $12. Part of that has been improving or increasing the number of tonnes that we sell globally, but the main thing even there has been, we've been able to bring on new sales tonnes without increasing our G&A, as a matter of fact, we've cut our G&A significantly even in the face of new tonnes coming - or new businesses coming into the portfolio and higher sales."", ""Excuse me, if we look at our individual businesses, starting with Phosphate, you can see here where our cost of mining rock despite the fact that over time your strip ratios get higher, your distances to your mine get longer, we've been able to really not only hold our cost, but if you look at 2018, our costs are the lowest they've been in over 5 years in both mining and in processing. So we think that is a real indication of what we're capable of in terms of this."", ""In potash, we see much the same thing, our costs have gone from around $130 a tonne down to $80 a tonne of cash cost over the last 5 years. So you can see, we've not only managed the portfolio, but within each of the mines and within the portfolio, we've really managed those costs to drive out significant cost in the business."", 'So where is the next set of improvements going to come from? I think the next set of improvements or the first set of improvements is going to come from the Esterhazy K3, if you will. Here there is going to be substantial cash flow benefits to the business overall.', ""I know this is a little busy to look at here, but if you look at it online afterwards, it really helps show in detail that we've never shown before the progress of the K3 project."", ""And so here what you see is a K3 project, where today we're probably spending $250 million of capital a year and spending $150 million on brine inflow every year. Over the next 5 years, we will reduce, both the capital and the brine inflow to virtually zero improving our overall cash flow as a company by $0.5 million or sorry, almost $0.5 billion, $400 million, at the same time improving our productive capacity of low-cost potash from Canada by 1 million tonne. So this is going to be a real big improver to our Potash business unit."", ""And importantly, for the Esterhazy K3 is this will be one of the lowest cost mines in the world. You're going to have or right near the shaft, it will be the highest tonnage, highest automated mines in the business today. So they've from an efficiency perspective, Esterhazy K3 will absolutely set the standard globally."", 'What does that ultimately mean from a cost perspective? And you can see, what I showed on the previous chart showing 2018 down to 2013 and the improvements in costs there. And so what we expect to see is another step down of somewhere in the range of $10 to $20 per tonne of cash cost as Esterhazy K3 takes over a bigger chunk of our total production.', 'So we expect to see costs in that $50 to $60 cash cost range once this thing is fully completed, which again, like I say, makes it probably one of the most competitive mines in the business.', ""From there, let me move on to the next big transformation of our business, if you will, which is the Fertilizantes business, and as Dan says, as we are coming up on a year of ownership here. And I would say, we can't be anything other than happy with the outcome of what we see."", ""When we first looked at the business, we talked about $75 million of synergies. After taking a harder look, we increased that and then finally, as we actually took a hard look at the business we brought that expected synergy number up to $275 million, which at that time people said was pretty aggressive. As we look at it now we think it was the right number, we think we're going to achieve that. We're not only going to achieve it, we're going to achieve it early. And this year alone, on Vale, year-to-date, we're already over $100 million in synergies and we're expecting to end the year at somewhere in that $140 million to $160 million of synergies."", ""So what we're seeing is a great opportunity in terms of the synergies and they're coming from all areas of the business. They're not just coming from people, but they're coming from the supply chain, from the integration of our distribution business with our production business. They're coming from being able to achieve better pricing in some of our commodities like our feed commodities. They're coming from procurement improvements because of being able to optimize procurement between those two businesses."", ""But altogether, we're really starting to see great accomplishments here, excuse me, and we expect that to be even more impactful next year when we get another, call it, $100 million of synergy in the second year and we'll really start seeing the impact of that business."", ""So I'd like to say we're - we've been really happy with where that business has been. We think even this year, we'll probably have a contribution of somewhere in the range of $0.15 per share of earnings. It'll contribute - the combined business this year will contribute well over $300 million of EBITDA."", ""So for a first year business, we think we've done very well. And those savings by the way are net of the cost to achieve as you can see in this graph. So in every way, we've done better here than we probably expected we would. I don't think we're finding synergies, we didn't expect to find, but we're finding that we can achieve them faster than we originally thought."", 'The next area of revenue side growth and again, these last three are both cost and revenue, but our premium products has been another really substantially successful aspect of our business over the last number of years and maybe massed a bit through the last couple of years, because the market has been poor.', ""But this is a business that has grown from when I started with Mosaic, we were selling probably 400,000 tonnes of premium products, today we are selling close to 2.8 million tonnes of premium product, MicroEssentials in particular. And it's now making up about 30% to 35% of our total production in our Phosphates business unit. So again, it's been a real success story, it's grown at over 10% a year."", ""Now we've introduced it in Brazil and it's taken off extremely well in Brazil. But again, this is the kind of product that we love to talk about, because it's added value to every piece of the value chain. The farmer gets better yield so he likes it. The distributor can - or the distributor or retailer, they can use it as a way of differentiating themselves as a retailer and so that helps them put bigger and better glue on their customers, if you will, and from our perspective of course, our margins are better and it draws more business from our retail and distributor customers."", ""So from that perspective, we think MicroEssentials has been an extremely successful product, not only from the margins it generates directly, but we believe from the ways in which it differentiates our business to our customers. And so from that perspective, we continue to drive this, we don't think the market's anywhere near saturated so we continue to drive the sales here."", 'And probably just as importantly, although some others have made look-alike products, there is yet to be anybody make a look alike product that really competes with MicroEssentials yet whether that be because of our sales experience, whether that be the experience that the retailers and the farmers have had with it, but we have a good first mover advantage here and nobody has been able to replicate it yet.', ""More recently we've added a second line of products, which we call the Aspire line of products, which is a potash, boron and this stage of boron enhanced to potash. And again, that is taking off very well and helping our customers, the farmers do a better job and continue to improve."", ""So that help - this really helps us as a company, three great projects whether it be Fertilizantes, K3 or MicroEssentials and Premium products, but they're all adding not only to the cost side benefits, but to the revenue side benefits. So a much needed or appreciated balance to things."", 'So we had a lot of improvements in the business, including the Vale Fertilizantes, the transformations, the efficiencies in our legacy businesses and of course MicroEssentials, all of those have given us what I would say, substantial market leverage and I think that has really been a good thing for us. And when does that really show up? It starts showing up when the markets start changing.', 'So let me change gears a bit and talk about our two markets particularly. And what we see now is, we see significant improvements in both phosphates and potash. And if I look at it this year particularly, phosphates has been a dramatic - while both, but phosphate first, the dramatic improvement to the market this year. And the catalyst for that was largely our own leadership aspects of idling the Plant City facility last October, November.', ""If you look at this graph, we were in the ballrooms for a couple of years, they are on the idling of Plant City, the market turned and we’ve seen a very good improvement there. We're now starting to see a little bit of the normal seasonal weakness that happens at the end of the year, but we believe phosphates is in a very good position."", ""That market's steadily grown, it's now on the 70 million-tonne range, continues to grow. The supply and demand also continues to be very tight and we think that bodes well for certainly the start of '19 and as we move forward."", 'And this is a good one to talk about the food story on, because I think phosphate demand there, you can really see the food story gets out of vogue from time to time, but the variability in our market has never been a demand driven variability. It has been new supply coming in and the time it takes to actually absorb that new supply. From a demand perspective, we believe the food story is absolutely intact.', 'The world population continues to grow, people continue to eat better and better diets and that continues to drive more demand for food, which drives more demand for fertilizer and we’re really starting to see that, well not starting to see that, but we continue to see that over the long-term in terms of demand for our own products and opportunities.', ""And so here as you look at phosphates, we see a market that's approved greatly and one that we believe will continue to be tight for the next year, 2 years and even 5 year time horizon."", ""Potash much the same interestingly enough, actions taken by Canpotex in 2016 to ration a bit of the potash - international potash market, tightened that market up to a point where you see the turn in 2016 and the constant rise since then. Again, the potash market has grown very steadily at 2.5-ish percent per year, a couple of exceptions in that growth that have thrown off a bit, one was a change to the Indian subsidy system in 2011-'12 and then than the breakup of BPC, the Russian Trade Association in 2013, but other than that, it's been a very steady growth story."", ""And if you look at the graph on the left, which is the pricing, you can see now that the majority of that incremental production that came on in that 2008 to 2012 range has been largely absorbed by the market, and we're seeing healthy return to the kind of pricing, may be not quite to the pricing of the 2014 kind of range, but we're starting to return closer to mid-cycle pricing."", ""As we look forward in potash, we continue to be reasonably bullish on potash as well. The projects, the big projects that were supposed to come on last year or the year before are just coming on now. They're coming on more slowly than expected and we continue to see a tight market for potash and as that market grows, we think that the growth will be more than enough to now absorb any incremental production that will probably come on from either the new Russian production or the new Canadian production that's being done by K+S [ph]."", 'And so we think that market is in good shape. And particularly, when you added to that, the closures of some of the operations like the Sigmundshall mine in Germany, if you look at mines like - or companies like SQM and Shanghai Lake, both are focusing more on lithium, which is reducing the potash output. All of which continues to tighten the potash market, and so we look at potash in a pretty good light.', ""And what I would highlight here is, with our cost structure now, we're starting to see real impact on that. And as you're probably well aware, we've raised our guidance twice this year, a lot of it has been just the earning leverage that we've had with this improving market and really being able to take advantage of it."", ""And if we look at the year-to-date results, this really highlights it, adjusted earnings per share so far this year of $1.35, net income $358 million, adjusted EBITDA year-to-date $1.4 billion. You compare that to last year where we had adjusted EPS of $1.09 for the year, the market improvement and we're really being able to take advantage of it because we've positioned ourselves well to do that."", ""And it really highlights our earnings leverage and of course, if I move to the next one, which is our leverage target debt pay down. What that's translated into is extremely strong cash flow for where we are in the market allowing us to pay down. We committed to paying down $700 million of term loans by the end of 2020."", ""We've, at the end of 3 quarters of 2018, after the purchase of Vale Fertilizantes, we've been able to achieve that and bring our debt levels down - net debt to adjusted EBITDA down to 2.2 this year, which really is well ahead of what the expectations were, and we think that really highlights the earnings capacity but also the cash flow capacity of this business as the markets improve."", 'So with all of that though one of the questions comes down, well what your capital allocation look like? And I want to leave a little bit of time for questions here, but I want to be clear here and just go through the capital allocation philosophy because this has not changed.', ""Our first priority has always been to maintain the financial strength and flexibility of business. That got stretched when we bought Vale's Fertilizantes business, but we believe we've done a lot of work in a short period of time to really bring that back into balance."", ""Our next priority though, if you will, is to sustain our assets. We want to make sure that we're in this for the long-term, so we're not going to skimp on sustaining capital, we want to make sure the business is well maintained. That doesn't mean were going to go crazy on spending sustaining capital, but expect that to stay at a reasonable rate as it did through the bottom of the market cycle and will continue."", ""After that, our philosophy has been and we're - while we're refining and it continues to be, let's make sure we spend the next dollar on what drives the largest shareholder value in terms of the long-term."", ""So whether that is - and that is a balanced approach between what are the organic growth opportunities that might be out there, opportunistic or strategic investments and of course, returning money to shareholders. I think that has to be all done in balance and I think, we've done a reasonable job in the past of making sure we kept that in balance and make no mistake, as we come out of this more difficult market scenario, we expect to have the same level of discipline going forward."", ""And I think that's important to highlight because I think one of the criticisms that can happen for particularly resource companies is, there is a feeling that when there's lots of money around they spend lots of money and when there isn't money around, they save money and that's probably the opposite of the way you should work things. I think when there is lots of money, you should putting it away for a rainy day, and when the rainy day comes that's when the opportunities come."", ""So we're very cognizant of that, we're going to continue to be disciplined, we're going to continue to be conservative. But I think we're also going to continue to look for how we can really deliver new opportunities that improve the company for all of our stakeholders, but particularly our shareholders."", 'So with that, I would like to say thank you for listening for a bit and open it up to questions from the room.']",management_discussion,MOS_144541

1414,James O'Rourke,"[""Yes. I think so today - I was just in China two weeks ago or three weeks ago or something and I had the opportunity to have dinner with Sinofert, one of the big companies. It's probably one of the worst kept secrets in China, but Sinofert's parent company is Sinochem. Sinochem is going to merge with ChemChina. ChemChina you may well be aware has just bought Syngenta. So they're building what's going to be one of the biggest ag-chem companies almost out there."", ""But I think the lag there, there is no question and you may have seen it yesterday with Andy's presentation that along the Yangtze River, there is a lot of restrictions being put on mining, particularly and processing."", ""Certainly the mining changes have come, but those haven't necessarily cascaded into the processing in the final finished product yet. And I think part of the reason for that is: one, they're working off inventory still, and secondly, the market is up by about $100 on where it was last year. So I think a lot of these people or a lot the Chinese companies are making some money while they can, if you will."", ""But I think there's no question in my mind that the Chinese government is dedicated to these environmental changes they're talking about. They will be shutting down these plants along the Yangtze River and either shutting them down for ever or at least moving them out beyond a certain barrier. And then they will be looking at how they store gypsum and all of that."", ""So I think there is no question that the changes are happening. I think may be the economics of those producers right now is driving that to be somewhat delayed in terms of how it gets manifested in the market. And from our perspective, I think '19, we're still saying there'll be a modest drop in '19 again. And we still believe there will be a modest drop in '18 even though right now it's sort of been flat. They still have the domestic market to supply."", ""And one of the things we want to highlight to everybody is, we talk about this, this is a 27 million tonne phosphate market. We're suggesting what they'll do is probably shut down 3 million to 4 million tonnes of that ultimately. So in other words - or decrease it by 3 to 4 million tonnes, so it won't change the domestic market, but it'll change the export market by 30%.""]",question_answer,MOS_144541
1415,Unidentified Analyst,"['And then on the MicroEssentials, you talked about the growth in that product over the past couple of years, you need to invest more to build capacity in that product.

1416,James O'Rourke,"[""So when we announced the MicroEssentials expansion at New Wales, that was a $225 million project done 4 years ago - 3 or 4 years ago. It took our total capacity up to about 3.5 million tonnes. Today we're running at about 2.8 million tonnes. And while we have capacity of 3.5 million tonnes, recognize that's not a perfect number, because during the spring season we run up against capacity constraints and during the off seasons, we probably have some excess."", ""So it's not like you can run steady all year, so we're probably already bumping up against capacity constraints at times. So it won't be that many more years until we have to make some investments. Those investments are - and I'm not avoiding your question, I'll come back to the premiums, but those investments probably will be modest, because I think what we've learnt over time is we've learnt how to operate these plants quite a bit better. So we're actually looking at how we can debottleneck existing plants first and then look at how we invest in new plants after that."", ""In terms of the premiums, today we charge a premium or we achieve a premium of about $40 a tonne for MicroEssentials. And actually our pricing strategy hasn't changed along the way. And I say a $40 premium, let me be clear, a margin premium, because it actually costs a slightly less to make MicroEssentials than it does normal DAP and MAP when - all told, not including the capital charge."", ""So overall, it's about a $30 price premium and about a $10 cost benefit. So overall, we make about $40 a tonne extra on MicroEssentials. And Aspire, I think, we charge about an $80 price premium, but I'm not sure exactly what the cost of boron is in that.

1418,James O'Rourke,"[""Yes, this is an often asked question, and there is a couple of reasons why K1 and K2 won't operate much past the timing. For one thing, we've stopped doing a lot of the development work or we will stop very soon stop doing the development work in K1 and K2 and move that development work over to K3. So while we're calling a K3 capital really it's offset by a decrease in capital in K1 and K2."", ""So we fully expect that there'll be very little development done, so we'll end up in a spot where we just won't have anywhere to go at the end and to recovery that would be expensive. But the other aspect that we're not increasing our process capacity."", 'So when we built the last expansion of Esterhazy, we built 1 million tonnes of excess processing capacity in anticipation of the K3 mine. The K3 mine will be able to deliver all of the productive capacity to both the K1 and the K2 processing facility.', ""So unless we increase the processing capacity beyond where it is today, K1 and K2 would not be beneficial from a production perspective anyway. So - and with the $150 million of brine cost, that's not that - that's not our best option for production.""]",question_answer,MOS_144541

1420,James O'Rourke,"['Well, let me say, in North America, Brazil, most markets, not at all. Neel, again, I use this as an example, my numbers might not be perfect because they change from time to time. But in the Illinois today, a $900 an acre revenue farm. So a 200 and some bushel per acre corn with $900 of revenue, the total cost of phosphate and potash is about $60.', ""So a 50%, even a 50% increase in price has a $20 or $30 impact on the overall profitability. The big costs on those are frankly land rent, seed, fuel, so all of those costs dwarf the cost of the two fertilizers. And the cost of nitrogen is about double that, so let's call it $120.

So maybe just give us an update of what's going on, what you're seeing, what's in your guidance, and we'll go from there.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007
1436,Clint Freeland,"[""Okay. Now, first of all, thank you for having us. Certainly happy to be here, and thank you. Thanks everybody for being here today. I think overall in the phosphate market, what we see is a market that is relatively balanced. We expect that to continue to be the case into next year. When you look at the different players you've got some incremental supply coming into the market as a couple of projects, specifically in Morocco and Saudi Arabia ramp up, you've got -- Nutrien is closing a couple of facilities themselves, Redwater and Geismar in particular. And I think we roughly see the market in balance, and that's before really any change from the Chinese. And I think that's kind of the wildcard. I think our view is, is that, in general and at least directionally, that we would expect to see somewhat lower exports out of China next year. The question is to what extent. And so given that you have kind of a balanced market outside of China and then an expectation for China to ramp down exports, at least to some extent, we continue to see a relatively tight market through '19. So that's in general how we view next year in the phosphate market. Now, specific to the fourth quarter, one of the things that you see, and I think it's happened in every year over the last five years is you've got a seasonal weakness into the fourth quarter. I think looking between our third and fourth quarter, we took down a gross margin per ton about $10 a ton. When you look at the average over the last five years of to what extent stripping margins and all have come down, it's quite a bit more than that. So it's not even as pronounced as we'd seen in the last five years. And also, it's important to note, that I think four out of the last five years the improvement in first quarter has made up for that weakness in the fourth quarter. So I think our view is that that's a seasonal dynamic. When we look at the fall application and the winter purchases, our thought was that that would begin happening a little sooner this year. But I think with all the wet weather I think that's been delayed. So that's something that we'll continue to watch. But I think overall the market still seems to be constructive longer-term. And in the short-term, I think it's more of a seasonal dynamic than anything.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007

1438,Clint Freeland,"[""I think -- and I think that's something that we expect to see in North America given some of the changing dynamics in the grain market because of the trade issue with China. But I think from a phosphate and potash perspective, I don't think it makes that big of a difference. When we look at crops grown, types of crops, and also crop prices, really the biggest determinant for us is acres planted. And given that both corn and soybeans require a meaningful amount of our nutrients, a little bit of change in the balance between them. But really the driving factor is more acres planted than anything. So I think even if you do see that in the United States I don't think it makes that big of a difference for us.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007

1440,Clint Freeland,"[""I don't think it's really had that much of an impact. I think where you see some of those tons going. The tons out of [indiscernible] tend to be flowing to Southeast Asia quite a bit. I think they have kind of designs on ultimately trying to get some of those tons as the facility ramps up a little bit more into maybe Brazil and the U.S., but I think primarily Southeast Asia at this point. I think OCP; we are seeing them a little bit more in North America. And the one thing that we're not seeing in North America is tons from [indiscernible]. I think a lot of those tons are actually flowing more to China, but really not in North America. So [indiscernible] get there a different day or a different topic, but yes, I think that's generally where we see those tons going.

1442,Clint Freeland,"[""I think kind of overall one of the things that you're seeing in the Chinese market is, well, a couple of things. First, I think you're seeing more stringent environmental requirements, which are also you've had the imposition of an environmental tax which is kind of lifting the cost structure of those producers. What you're also seeing the rock production is down about 30%, and so you're seeing rock prices increasing. And so when you look at those things as well as some of the raw material prices, those are creeping up as well. So cost structure is going up. And so a lot of the MAP producers tend to be the nonintegrated players, where they're generally less efficient. And so they're seeing their costs increase, and so their ability to kind of price that through is a little more challenged. And so I think that's kind of why you're seeing. Whereas with DAP, I think those are more of the efficient players that can absorb some of those costs maybe a little bit better. And I think that's why you're kind of seeing the differential between MAP and DAP.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007
1443,Unidentified Analyst,"['Now, you referenced phosphate rock price.']",question_answer,MOS_144007
1444,Clint Freeland,"[""And if can maybe add one other thing is that one of the things that actually is a good signal for us is that to the extent that they can continue to export tons, that means that despite their higher cost structure they can still make money in that market, which means higher prices, which again is a good thing for us. So even though you have that difference between the DAP and MAP there, I think some of the things that we're seeing there are good data points for us.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007
1445,Unidentified Analyst,"[""So there are two interesting dynamics that come up within that one -- before was just sort of -- now, you reference phosphate rock prices are back on the upswing. I feel like at this time last year there was kind of a knife fight going on between -- in the export rock market and people competing on price. That seems to have run its course, and now maybe we're starting to get some recovery in rock prices. Is that sort of the general dynamic you see when you look around at all the merchant rock regions?""]",question_answer,MOS_144007
1446,Clint Freeland,"[""It is. I think in general, what we're seeing is kind of slow escalation in rock prices, a strengthening. But also, not rising fast enough or materially enough to incent new production. And so I think, generally, the players in that market, and I think OCP is probably the biggest player, I think are being very rational in how they are selling and pricing their rock to respond to the market, but not let things get too out of hand at an incent response.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007
1447,Unidentified Analyst,"[""And then also mentioned sort of if China is exporting more to the higher prices, and higher prices are obviously good, but sort of in some mixed data points on price. In other words, obviously in one hand we've got India challenge with the rupee, and so maybe we're going to start to see some demand issues from them from an affordability perspective. On the other hand, demand overall has been quite solid for the last few years. So the environment seems quite healthy. So where do you see sort of the price of a finished ton of DAP around the world in terms of farmer affordability? Are we still in most areas in a comfortable zone of affordability, where demand should continue to grow well? Are we starting to challenge some of these regions from a price perspective?""]",question_answer,MOS_144007
1448,Clint Freeland,"[""I think generally speaking certainly the price of the product is higher than it was last year. But I think generally speaking, it's still affordable. If you kind of go around give globe, in North America, we've had record yields, record amount of nutrients being taken out of the ground. I think they're generally being replaced. And so I think we see the North American market remaining pretty consistent next year with this year. I think when you look at Brazil, kind of same type of dynamic. Their market continues to grow, their acreage continues to grow. I think that's going to continue to be a good place to be. And then also farmer economics there, I think they've done very well this year with the rise in, particularly, soybean prices, but in grain prices as a result of some of the issues between the U.S. and China. The prices for them have gotten better, the currency had weakened. So the spread that they're earning is good. So I think they're doing really well. I think to your point about India that certainly is something that we've been watching. But I think some of the support prices that have gone into place I think has helped to offset some of the rupee weakness. And so I think our expectation, you know, Dr. Ron looks out over the next year, I think we expect demand to actually increase to some extent in India over the next year. So, again, I think prices certainly have strengthened relative to last year. But I don't think we're getting to the point in any of the major markets that farmer affordability is expected to start whittling away at demand.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007

1450,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes. So when we originally took Plant City and idled it, kind of the expectation was that with the new capacity out of Morocco and out of Saudi Arabia that longer-term there would be length in the market of about 1.5 million tons of capacity. And that was about the size of Plant City. And it's kind of a third quartile cost structure facility, so we decided to remove that from the market, and obviously that's had an impact. And I think as we go forward, one of the things that -- it's idled now, so it's not officially shut, it's not officially back online. But one of the things that we would need to see I think to consider brining that back online is that there's a structural imbalance between supply and demand longer-term, not just kind of a one-year event or two-year event. It would take some investment. We'd have to start rehiring a bunch of the workers that would be there. So, it's not an insignificant lift, if you will, to bring that back online. With that said, I can say it, that we have sent a letter in requesting the continued idling of that facility. That's what we would like to do.

As far as kind of large scale capacity additions, hard to see that right now. One of the things that we also want to keep our eye on is demand around our MicroEssentials product, and is there additional opportunity there, and where is the best place for that.

I think for us, we do view Brazil as a growth platform for us. We have things from production all the way to the farm. And we have thousands of customers there. And the question for us over time is going to be how do we really leverage that presence, and just to give investors a sense, for a 35 million ton market we sell about nine million tons in that market. So call it 25% to 30% market share, again with kind of the full value chain from production all the way to the farm. We do buy potash and phosphates from outside the country to deliver there through our distribution business. We do buy MicroEssentials from North America to again deliver into that market. And that's a really growing market for us. I mean we're upwards of a million tons at this point in MicroEssentials this year, and growing. So I think as we look at the production platform there we'll, first of all, we need to kind of get that business to where we want it to be, assess whether or not we need more in-country capacity, and then assess things like are there incremental investments in specialty products, like MicroEssentials or something like that that would be best produced and delivered down there locally.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007

1468,Clint Freeland,"[""So, a lot of topics there, but we'll start with kind of the fundamental economics of our Brazilian business as it relates to FX, is that our revenue line is generally dollar based or dollar equivalent. And so it doesn't have a lot of FX exposure. But our operating cost in-country are generally real based. And so what we do is we actually based a hedging program. On a rolling three-month basis we're basically hedging out the net exposure, and look to try to kind of stabilize that. Longer-term, kind of beyond that three-month timeframe, we have a pretty good idea of what our reais-based cost structure looks like, but we don't really know what our dollar-based revenues are going to be. So we also have a hedging program around that longer-term to at least provide some level of protection longer-term. I think from an FX standpoint what that program does for us is it takes out some of the near-term volatility. And we saw that quite a bit, obviously, in the past year. So it tries to smooth that out quite a bit. But longer-term, we will continue to be subject to the changes in FX, but it should be kind of a smoother impact over time. I think from an election standpoint, I think we would agree with you that I think Bolsonaro has made a lot of positive comments around the agricultural business. I think he got support from that sector in the election. And the thing that we'll just need to kind of watch over time is, is he able to pull together the coalition that he needs to actually put into effect what he's talked about. But I think generally we're optimistic around the results of the election. We'll just need to see what can be delivered over time.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007

1472,Clint Freeland,"[""So the way that I would phrase it is anything that increases the cost of getting final product to the end customer should benefit us, given our in-country production, and whether it's freight or whether it's anything else to the extent that that works its way through the pricing mechanism and clearing price, then that generally would be good for us, because roughly call it half of our production is in-country and I think when we look at competitor logistics call we've got about $70 a ton benefit from having an in-country position on all of those tons.

1474,Clint Freeland,"[""Well, I think similar to phosphates; one of the things that we're seeing is the first continued growth in demand around the world for potash. And at the same time, a number of the large projects that were expected to come online have been experiencing delays, and whether it's the Bassoon mine in Canada or whether it's European facilities, I think locality not really show what's happening with one of their facility, the Turkmenistan facility. And then, as you roll into next year, I think you have got the Boulby mine, Sigmundshall mine, will be closing, you've got SQM and we believe watching highlights pivoting more to lithium and away from potash. So when we look at the S&D, it looks pretty tight. And as a matter of fact, during what is normally kind of a seasonally weaker part of the year in the fourth quarter, we've actually been able to experience price increases through that period. So I think our view certainly near-term and longer term is that the market is fairly balanced if not a little short, and frankly, the longer it takes for some of these projects to come online, the more able the market is to absorb those tons without having any price disruption.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007

1476,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes. So I would say in general over time, certainly isn't something that you kind of trying to speak it on tomorrow, but I think over time we've got probably a couple of million tons of extra capacity that could be brought online with some investment with some time to satisfy any shortfall in the market. And I think we kind of ramp down operations or scale down operations at [indiscernible] a few years ago, and I think if the market signals were there and it makes sense for us to do something there, we need to hire people back or some investments that we would need to make it would take us some time, but we could do, get some incremental tons out of that facility, I think Belle Plaine is probably a little bit of capacity. And then also as we ramp up K3, our plan is to kind of ramp up -- to ramp down K1 and 2 as we're ramping up K3, but there may be some ability to at least for a short-term period of time to kind of take some additional production in there.

1478,Clint Freeland,"['I think overall there likely is; the question is do you call it synergies or do you call it something else, right? And so, I think the way that we\'ve approached this is that when we said our synergy target, we said we see $275 million in synergies associated with combining the businesses, and obviously as you mentioned, we\'re ahead of target on achieving those at this point. And we remain very comfortable with the $275 million bogey. I think the way that we\'re approaching it is when we hit the 275, we\'re going to say, okay, kind of plant the flag, if you will, and say, ""Okay, our synergy program is done."" But similar to how we run our potash and phosphate business as long as we run, as long as we have those businesses, we continue to see opportunity to improve those businesses. Transformation initiatives are continuing to put downward pressure on cost structure and so forth, I would see the exact same thing with the Brazilian business where from a transaction synergy standpoint, will get the $275 million, we will deliver on what we committed to. And then, thereafter, I think we kind of put it into the same program as the other two businesses into kind of continued transformation, continuous improvement type of programs. And with any scale business there should always be opportunities for improvement and so I would, I think there probably is opportunity above the $275 million but I think it probably falls into a different program if you will.']",question_answer,MOS_144007
1479,Unidentified Analyst,"[""Fair enough. Last one for me, and then we'll turn it over to audience Q&A. You paid down the debt that your targeted, you've reached sort of your through the cycle leverage target. So what is sort of the capital allocation sort of program from here? How are you guys thinking about it?""]",question_answer,MOS_144007
1480,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes, I guess, I would start by saying that we're doing quite a bit of work around that right now and I think we'll look to provide greater clarity at the beginning of next year, but I think as you mentioned we had a $700 million debt pay down commitment. We by the end of 2020, we've obviously already hit that and I think we're kind of within our debt to EBITDA -- net debt to EBITDA stated leverage target. The one thing that I would note though, because we're giving some thought to this is, when you look over the last 8 to 10 years at one point or EBITDA was it $3 billion, another point it's at $1.1 to $1.2 billion. And so, when you say, well what's your leverage target on a debt to EBITDA basis, I will tell you where you are in the cycle, tell me what your EBITDA is because if you target kind of a mid-cycle type of leverage ratio well then what it says is, is that in the better times, you really kind of encouraged to lever up and then all of a sudden when things turn, you find yourself overlapping. And when you look at kind of use of proceeds and what you're doing with your capital from an allocation standpoint, you're probably deploying capital and buying things during the better part of the cycle and then you're stretched and you are like can't, make moves at the bottom part of the cycle, which a lot of times is where strategic opportunity lies like the Vale transaction, maybe that's a better time for share repurchases and other things. But maybe you don't have the wherewithal and so I think as we go forward one of the things that we are giving thought to is now that we've recalibrated our balance sheet from the leverage standpoint, a better place. Should we as part of a balanced program look to continue to put downward pressure on debt outstanding to where you've kind of got a balanced program continuing to strengthen the balance sheet continuing to look at and making good risk adjusted return investments and also returning capital access capital to shareholders over time. But almost think about our leverage and balance sheet targets more in terms of what do you want to look like in the downside scenario, in that scenario, the last trough which are able to go to 1.2 billion that's when Vale became available to us. We had to stretch our balance sheet to do this, right deal, right time, good value, but we were downgraded by the agencies that had to cut our dividend twice probably didn't have the level of flexibility that we'd like to have going forward and so I think as we are kind of thinking about our approach we are kind of questioning whether or not we should say in a tougher part of the cycle since our last trough, we've added our Brazilian business, we're transitioning away from K1 and K2 over the K3, I think that has a cost structure and a profitability impact, which is positive, less CapEx, no bond management cost. Our phosphate business is continuing to transform its cost structure and so kind of what do you think kind of a downside scenario looks like and what do you want your balance sheet to look like at that point to not only be able to withstand, more difficult parts of the cycle but also to have the wherewithal to act and to deploy capital you know, if opportunity presents itself. Now, what I would also say is it kind of becomes a higher-class problem. But if you take that approach what that does necessarily mean is that in better times in the cycle, you will, your balance sheet will look somewhat under levered. And so, I think at that point in the cycle, you need to be really disciplined around your capital allocation and be sure that the capital that you are generating, if you don't need it to recalibrate your balance sheet that any investments that you make or other allocations of capital are really thoughtful and disciplined. But I think over time, I think we've hit our leverage target that we've said from a true cycle standpoint, but I think over time, we may want to rethink that and really try to build in a level of strength and flexibility kind of throughout the entire cycle, not just mid-cycle.

1483,Clint Freeland,"[""Look, I don't know that there are any specific metrics. I mean, I think you can certainly look at history, I think you can look at kind of where you expect supply demand to go and where you expect those prices to go, do you feel like you are enterprising environment that that encourages new build, but I don't know that they are kind of specific, kind of KPIs, if you will, to kind of determine where you are in the cycle. Again, I think you just have the benefit of history and look at things like whether its prices or margins or so forth. I think that's kind of an indication but I think its kind of a little bit harder to say exactly where you are at any one point in the cycle. I think our view though, is that, certainly we've seen improvements over the last, year in particular, when we look out over the next five, we generally see the market that's roughly in balance depending on a couple of things here and there, whether that constitutes mid cycle or better, I'm not really sure but, there's nothing really that I can point to kind of calibrate where you are in that cycle. I think you just need to from my perspective, just accept that the company in the industry is cyclical, you are going to see good parts of the cycle, you are going to see tougher parts of the cycle. Some of those cycles can be longer than others, but I think it's always prudent to kind of be sure that you're preparing for the down cycle. And when you are seeing a better part of that, better pricing environment, be really thoughtful about how you deploy those, that capital and those resources to be sure that you're not being wasteful. And be sure that you're actually strengthening the company from a cost structure and from an operational and financial standpoint to better weather the coming cycle whenever it were to come.""]",question_answer,MOS_144007

1485,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes, so I think, in general, I think things have played out at least as well as we expected. We have said historically that we thought that the acquisition would be $0.05 to $0.10 accretive on an EPS basis, I think when we run our math year-to-date, we are at or above the top end of that, I think when we looked at the business and saw, looked at $275 million, in synergies, we feel like that's there we are obviously a head of that game. So, I mean, I think from a currency standpoint, I think our expectation was that the BRL to the U.S. dollar would be roughly about 36. That's basically what it's averaged year-to-date. You've seen some volatility in there, but that's basically what is average, so I think in general, I think things have played out generally in line with our expectations. Certainly, we've seen a nice pricing environment. I'm not sure, I've only been there five months, I'm not sure what was baked into the original forecast, but I think in general, I think things have played out in line with our expectations, if not, maybe a little better.

1490,Unidentified Analyst,"[""Maybe let's just start with sort of in phosphate, just a general market update. You reported you took down the fourth quarter a bit on phosphate just sort of given what's happening with the fall season, and the rain, and the application. So maybe just give us an update of what's going on, what you're seeing, what's in your guidance, and we'll go from there.""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1491,Clint Freeland,"[""Okay. Now, first of all, thank you for having us. Certainly happy to be here, and thank you. Thanks everybody for being here today. I think overall in the phosphate market, what we see is a market that is relatively balanced. We expect that to continue to be the case into next year. When you look at the different players you've got some incremental supply coming into the market as a couple of projects, specifically in Morocco and Saudi Arabia ramp up, you've got -- Nutrien is closing a couple of facilities themselves, Redwater and Geismar in particular. And I think we roughly see the market in balance, and that's before really any change from the Chinese."", ""And I think that's kind of the wildcard. I think our view is, is that, in general and at least directionally, that we would expect to see somewhat lower exports out of China next year. The question is to what extent. And so given that you have kind of a balanced market outside of China and then an expectation for China to ramp down exports, at least to some extent, we continue to see a relatively tight market through '19. So that's in general how we view next year in the phosphate market."", ""Now, specific to the fourth quarter, one of the things that you see, and I think it's happened in every year over the last five years is you've got a seasonal weakness into the fourth quarter. I think looking between our third and fourth quarter, we took down a gross margin per ton about $10 a ton. When you look at the average over the last five years of to what extent stripping margins and all have come down, it's quite a bit more than that. So it's not even as pronounced as we'd seen in the last five years. And also, it's important to note, that I think four out of the last five years the improvement in first quarter has made up for that weakness in the fourth quarter."", ""So I think our view is that that's a seasonal dynamic. When we look at the fall application and the winter purchases, our thought was that that would begin happening a little sooner this year. But I think with all the wet weather I think that's been delayed. So that's something that we'll continue to watch. But I think overall the market still seems to be constructive longer-term.

1493,Clint Freeland,"[""I think -- and I think that's something that we expect to see in North America given some of the changing dynamics in the grain market because of the trade issue with China. But I think from a phosphate and potash perspective, I don't think it makes that big of a difference. When we look at crops grown, types of crops, and also crop prices, really the biggest determinant for us is acres planted. And given that both corn and soybeans require a meaningful amount of our nutrients, a little bit of change in the balance between them. But really the driving factor is more acres planted than anything.

1494,Unidentified Analyst,"[""Okay. Maybe if we step back sort of a little bit more globally. There's been a lot of conversation in the investment community over the last couple of years about the new capacity that's coming online, whether it's in Morocco or in Saudi Arabia.

1495,Clint Freeland,"[""I don't think it's really had that much of an impact. I think where you see some of those tons going. The tons out of [indiscernible] tend to be flowing to Southeast Asia quite a bit. I think they have kind of designs on ultimately trying to get some of those tons as the facility ramps up a little bit more into maybe Brazil and the U.S., but I think primarily Southeast Asia at this point. I think OCP; we are seeing them a little bit more in North America. And the one thing that we're not seeing in North America is tons from [indiscernible]. I think a lot of those tons are actually flowing more to China, but really not in North America."", ""So [indiscernible] get there a different day or a different topic, but yes, I think that's generally where we see those tons going.

1497,Clint Freeland,"[""I think kind of overall one of the things that you're seeing in the Chinese market is, well, a couple of things. First, I think you're seeing more stringent environmental requirements, which are also you've had the imposition of an environmental tax which is kind of lifting the cost structure of those producers. What you're also seeing the rock production is down about 30%, and so you're seeing rock prices increasing. And so when you look at those things as well as some of the raw material prices, those are creeping up as well. So cost structure is going up. And so a lot of the MAP producers tend to be the nonintegrated players, where they're generally less efficient. And so they're seeing their costs increase, and so their ability to kind of price that through is a little more challenged. And so I think that's kind of why you're seeing."", ""Whereas with DAP, I think those are more of the efficient players that can absorb some of those costs maybe a little bit better.

1498,Unidentified Analyst,"['Now, you referenced phosphate rock price.']",question_answer,MOS_228615
1499,Clint Freeland,"[""And if can maybe add one other thing is that one of the things that actually is a good signal for us is that to the extent that they can continue to export tons, that means that despite their higher cost structure they can still make money in that market, which means higher prices, which again is a good thing for us. So even though you have that difference between the DAP and MAP there, I think some of the things that we're seeing there are good data points for us.""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1500,Unidentified Analyst,"[""So there are two interesting dynamics that come up within that one -- before was just sort of -- now, you reference phosphate rock prices are back on the upswing. I feel like at this time last year there was kind of a knife fight going on between -- in the export rock market and people competing on price. That seems to have run its course, and now maybe we're starting to get some recovery in rock prices. Is that sort of the general dynamic you see when you look around at all the merchant rock regions?""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1501,Clint Freeland,"[""It is. I think in general, what we're seeing is kind of slow escalation in rock prices, a strengthening. But also, not rising fast enough or materially enough to incent new production. And so I think, generally, the players in that market, and I think OCP is probably the biggest player, I think are being very rational in how they are selling and pricing their rock to respond to the market, but not let things get too out of hand at an incent response.""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1502,Unidentified Analyst,"[""And then also mentioned sort of if China is exporting more to the higher prices, and higher prices are obviously good, but sort of in some mixed data points on price. In other words, obviously in one hand we've got India challenge with the rupee, and so maybe we're going to start to see some demand issues from them from an affordability perspective. On the other hand, demand overall has been quite solid for the last few years. So the environment seems quite healthy. So where do you see sort of the price of a finished ton of DAP around the world in terms of farmer affordability? Are we still in most areas in a comfortable zone of affordability, where demand should continue to grow well? Are we starting to challenge some of these regions from a price perspective?""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1503,Clint Freeland,"[""I think generally speaking certainly the price of the product is higher than it was last year. But I think generally speaking, it's still affordable. If you kind of go around give globe, in North America, we've had record yields, record amount of nutrients being taken out of the ground. I think they're generally being replaced. And so I think we see the North American market remaining pretty consistent next year with this year. I think when you look at Brazil, kind of same type of dynamic. Their market continues to grow, their acreage continues to grow. I think that's going to continue to be a good place to be."", ""And then also farmer economics there, I think they've done very well this year with the rise in, particularly, soybean prices, but in grain prices as a result of some of the issues between the U.S. and China. The prices for them have gotten better, the currency had weakened. So the spread that they're earning is good. So I think they're doing really well."", ""I think to your point about India that certainly is something that we've been watching. But I think some of the support prices that have gone into place I think has helped to offset some of the rupee weakness. And so I think our expectation, you know, Dr. Ron looks out over the next year, I think we expect demand to actually increase to some extent in India over the next year. So, again, I think prices certainly have strengthened relative to last year.

On a rolling three-month basis we're basically hedging out the net exposure, and look to try to kind of stabilize that. Longer-term, kind of beyond that three-month timeframe, we have a pretty good idea of what our reais-based cost structure looks like, but we don't really know what our dollar-based revenues are going to be.

1531,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes. So I would say in general over time, certainly isn't something that you kind of trying to speak it on tomorrow, but I think over time we've got probably a couple of million tons of extra capacity that could be brought online with some investment with some time to satisfy any shortfall in the market. And I think we kind of ramp down operations or scale down operations at [indiscernible] a few years ago, and I think if the market signals were there and it makes sense for us to do something there, we need to hire people back or some investments that we would need to make it would take us some time, but we could do, get some incremental tons out of that facility, I think Belle Plaine is probably a little bit of capacity. And then also as we ramp up K3, our plan is to kind of ramp up -- to ramp down K1 and 2 as we're ramping up K3, but there may be some ability to at least for a short-term period of time to kind of take some additional production in there. So I think in total it comes about 2 million tons, but again, over time not something that we could turn on real quickly.""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1532,Unidentified Analyst,"[""Okay, great. May be just a couple last questions, one, you did originally upgrade the synergy target for Fertilizantes and exhibited a lot of confidence in hitting it on last week's call, are there -- is there any sort of upside to that target over time?""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1533,Clint Freeland,"[""I think overall there likely is; the question is do you call it synergies or do you call it something else, right? And so, I think the way that we've approached this is that when we said our synergy target, we said we see $275 million in synergies associated with combining the businesses, and obviously as you mentioned, we're ahead of target on achieving those at this point. And we remain very comfortable with the $275 million bogey."", 'I think the way that we\'re approaching it is when we hit the 275, we\'re going to say, okay, kind of plant the flag, if you will, and say, ""Okay, our synergy program is done."" But similar to how we run our potash and phosphate business as long as we run, as long as we have those businesses, we continue to see opportunity to improve those businesses. Transformation initiatives are continuing to put downward pressure on cost structure and so forth, I would see the exact same thing with the Brazilian business where from a transaction synergy standpoint, will get the $275 million, we will deliver on what we committed to. And then, thereafter, I think we kind of put it into the same program as the other two businesses into kind of continued transformation, continuous improvement type of programs. And with any scale business there should always be opportunities for improvement and so I would, I think there probably is opportunity above the $275 million but I think it probably falls into a different program if you will.']",question_answer,MOS_228615
1534,Unidentified Analyst,"[""Fair enough. Last one for me, and then we'll turn it over to audience Q&A. You paid down the debt that your targeted, you've reached sort of your through the cycle leverage target. So what is sort of the capital allocation sort of program from here? How are you guys thinking about it?""]",question_answer,MOS_228615
1535,Clint Freeland,"[""Yes, I guess, I would start by saying that we're doing quite a bit of work around that right now and I think we'll look to provide greater clarity at the beginning of next year, but I think as you mentioned we had a $700 million debt pay down commitment. We by the end of 2020, we've obviously already hit that and I think we're kind of within our debt to EBITDA -- net debt to EBITDA stated leverage target. The one thing that I would note though, because we're giving some thought to this is, when you look over the last 8 to 10 years at one point or EBITDA was it $3 billion, another point it's at $1.1 to $1.2 billion. And so, when you say, well what's your leverage target on a debt to EBITDA basis, I will tell you where you are in the cycle, tell me what your EBITDA is because if you target kind of a mid-cycle type of leverage ratio well then what it says is, is that in the better times, you really kind of encouraged to lever up and then all of a sudden when things turn, you find yourself overlapping. And when you look at kind of use of proceeds and what you're doing with your capital from an allocation standpoint, you're probably deploying capital and buying things during the better part of the cycle and then you're stretched and you are like can't, make moves at the bottom part of the cycle, which a lot of times is where strategic opportunity lies like the Vale transaction, maybe that's a better time for share repurchases and other things. But maybe you don't have the wherewithal and so I think as we go forward one of the things that we are giving thought to is now that we've recalibrated our balance sheet from the leverage standpoint, a better place."", ""Should we as part of a balanced program look to continue to put downward pressure on debt outstanding to where you've kind of got a balanced program continuing to strengthen the balance sheet continuing to look at and making good risk adjusted return investments and also returning capital access capital to shareholders over time. But almost think about our leverage and balance sheet targets more in terms of what do you want to look like in the downside scenario, in that scenario, the last trough which are able to go to 1.2 billion that's when Vale became available to us. We had to stretch our balance sheet to do this, right deal, right time, good value, but we were downgraded by the agencies that had to cut our dividend twice probably didn't have the level of flexibility that we'd like to have going forward and so I think as we are kind of thinking about our approach we are kind of questioning whether or not we should say in a tougher part of the cycle since our last trough, we've added our Brazilian business, we're transitioning away from K1 and K2 over the K3, I think that has a cost structure and a profitability impact, which is positive, less CapEx, no bond management cost."", 'Our phosphate business is continuing to transform its cost structure and so kind of what do you think kind of a downside scenario looks like and what do you want your balance sheet to look like at that point to not only be able to withstand, more difficult parts of the cycle but also to have the wherewithal to act and to deploy capital you know, if opportunity presents itself.', ""Now, what I would also say is it kind of becomes a higher-class problem. But if you take that approach what that does necessarily mean is that in better times in the cycle, you will, your balance sheet will look somewhat under levered. And so, I think at that point in the cycle, you need to be really disciplined around your capital allocation and be sure that the capital that you are generating, if you don't need it to recalibrate your balance sheet that any investments that you make or other allocations of capital are really thoughtful and disciplined. But I think over time, I think we've hit our leverage target that we've said from a true cycle standpoint, but I think over time, we may want to rethink that and really try to build in a level of strength and flexibility kind of throughout the entire cycle, not just mid-cycle."", 'Okay, any questions from the audience?']",question_answer,MOS_228615

1546,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. Mosaic's momentum continue to build in the third quarter. Our results reflect improved market conditions as well as the benefits of the many moves we've made to strengthen the company. Our key points today are, first, Mosaic has made tremendous progress. We've transformed our businesses and created significant operational leverage. Second, global potash and phosphate market fundamentals are improving. Demand growth remained strong while supply is materializing slowly. And, third, as a result of our increased operational leverage and improving market conditions, we are optimistic about our future, both near and longer term. We have a road map to generate significant cash and drive strong shareholder returns."", ""For the quarter, Mosaic's net earnings were $247 million compared with $227 million a year ago. Year-to-date, net earnings were $358 million. We delivered earnings per share of $0.64 or $0.75 net of notable items, a year-over-year increase of 78% despite our higher share count. Just one year ago, we announced significant financial and operational moves to position the company for success. We idled our Plant City phosphate operations and indicated we would focus on increasing the efficiency and recovery rate at our remaining phosphate plants."", ""We announced significant increases in our expected transformational targets related to Mosaic Fertilizantes, and we announced our intention to delever the balance sheet by 2020. Since we announced these actions, we have accelerated our progress and created significant earnings leverage as today's results clearly indicate. We reported year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion. We increased our 2018 synergy expectation from Mosaic Fertilizantes, and we announced we've reached our through-cycle debt-to-EBITDA targets."", 'Overall, good market conditions and robust performance across our three business units are leading to better 2018 results than our initial expectations. Today, we increased our guidance for 2018 annual adjusted EBITDA to a range of $1.9 billion to $2 billion and our adjusted earnings per share guidance to a range of $1.80 to $2 per share.', ""Let's start with Mosaic Fertilizantes, our business in South America. Year-to-date, in 2018, Mosaic Fertilizantes has delivered adjusted EBITDA of $277 million compared with the pro forma EBITDA of $50 million a year ago. The performance of that business has been helped by excellent Brazilian agricultural market conditions and a weaker Brazilian real. But the key driver of the improved earnings has been our transformation of the business. We are achieving synergies faster than expected and we now expect to reach $140 million to $160 million in net savings in 2018. We also expect to reach our target of $275 million in net savings well before the end of 2020."", 'The transformation of the business and the benefits of our upstream/downstream integration are easily visible, both on the ground in Brazil and in our results. Across our plants and mines, employees are energized and they are bringing innovative ideas to improve our operating efficiency. When we announced the transaction, we expected it to be accretive to earnings. Year-to-date, the acquired business has added $0.11 per share, inclusive of the impact of issuing $1 billion in debt and 34 million shares, but exclusive of the $8 million reserve in the third quarter for the potential of paying out on the contingent portion of the purchase price.', 'Moving onto the phosphate market, which remains relatively tight, prices held steady following a $75 increase over the past year. Margins are under a bit of pressure with raw material prices rising. Still fundamentals are very strong. In fact, our outlook for Phosphates has continued to improve over the past several quarters.', 'Global demand continues to grow and our market analysis team expects another record year for shipments in 2019. Several actions have tightened supply, including the idling of our Plant City facility, slower-than-expected ramp-ups of new facilities, and reduced Chinese export. In 2019, we expect global demand growth to outpace supply additions, requiring higher global operating rates and providing support to prices and margins.', 'The market is feeling a temporary impact from the wet fall in North America. The expectation of an early harvest and in turn an early fall fertilizer application season has not come to fruition. Shifts in agricultural seasons can delay or accelerate demand, but they rarely affect the full-year sales. It is important to remember that this business is seasonal, as well as cyclical.', ""This expected seasonality is reflected in our guidance for the quarter and for the full year. The changes we've made in our phosphate business magnify the impact of these improving market conditions. Transformation is well under way in our Phosphates business unit, which has produced $653 million of year-to-date adjusted EBITDA, up almost twofold compared to the same period a year ago."", 'We have made extensive structural permanent changes to the way we operate, resulting in a much more efficient business for the long term. We said we would run our remaining plant harder and we have, with operating rates up 7% year-over-year.', ""Let's move on to Potash. The potash market is tighter today than it has been in years and prices are moving up as a result. In addition, the discount we saw recently in the U.S. has largely disappeared. Supply disruptions experienced by some of our competitors and the slow ramp-up of new supply, combined with growing global demand, have driven potash prices higher by approximately $60 per tonne over the prior year. The Potash business unit began its transformation before the other segments, as its consistently low cost base demonstrates."", 'The teams at our three world-class potash mines are executing at a very high level, with strong day to day production and like our other business units, excellent safety and environmental performance. At the same time, the ramp-up of Esterhazy K3 continues according to our expectations. As the transition progresses, we will have the ability to drive production costs still lower with an efficient new mine and phasing out of brine management expenses at K1 and K2. In fact, we completed the conveyor belt tie in from the K3 shaft to the K2 mill this summer.', ""Now, I'd like to turn the call over to Clint Freeland to discuss current period results and near-term guidance.

During the third quarter, Mosaic generated $0.64 in fully diluted earnings per share, $0.75 per share after adjusting for notable items; and adjusted EBITDA of $606 million. As noted earlier, these strong results were driven by the combination of continued progress on our cost structure and business transformation initiatives across the company and improved market conditions. With these strong quarterly earnings came strong cash flow from operations at $524 million.', 'As you can see, Mosaic ended the third quarter with just over $1 billion in unrestricted cash, roughly in line with the balance at the end of the second quarter despite paying down $400 million in debt during the quarter, investing $241 million in CapEx, and experiencing a $200 million reversal in customer prepayments in Brazil.', 'Based on the strong financial performance to-date and our outlook for the rest of the year, we are increasing our full year earnings guidance for the third time this year. We now expect the company to generate adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion to $2 billion and adjusted earnings per share $1.80 to $2.', 'In addition to strong year-to-date results, our guidance reflects continued strength into the fourth quarter, albeit with normal seasonality; the accelerated realization of synergies in Brazil, as outlined earlier; and a foreign exchange rate of roughly BRL 3.7 to the U.S. dollar.', 'The primary risk in our fourth quarter outlook is currency-related given the recent volatility of certain currencies, particularly the Brazilian real. That said, as always, we continue to monitor grain and oilseed prices and international trade developments and any impact that they may have on finished fertilizer markets.', ""Mosaic's substantial cash generation over the course of this year has allowed us to pay down $700 million of debt, meeting our deleveraging commitment two years ahead of schedule. While our debt metrics are now more in line with previously-disclosed through-cycle target levels, we are cognizant of the cyclical nature of our industry and the necessity for financial strength and stability through all parts of the cycle."", ""It's important to note the sensitivity of our leverage ratio to prices. For example, a $20 per tonne change in product pricing can move adjusted EBITDA by $340 million and net debt to EBITDA by 0.4 turns. As such, we intend to continue evaluating whether further debt reduction over time as part of a balanced capital allocation program is appropriate."", ""With that said, our capital philosophy has not changed. Our top priority continues to be ensuring a solid long term foundation for the company. We will continue to invest in our core assets to ensure they're safe, reliable, and efficient operation and maintain financial strength and flexibility through prudent balance sheet management.

And so, some of the nervousness in the market that happens at this time seasonally is starting to abate because of the strong movement in the shipments."", ""Some of that margin pressure is a little bit of price compression only in the North American market, which was at a significant premium to the other global markets, as well as a little bit of raw material price increase.

So, I think when it comes to allocating capital, as we've talked about before, our first priority is ensuring that the company has a really solid financial and operational foundation, making sure that the company's leverage profile and liquidity position is where it should be to remain strong and flexible through the cycle. I think it's also important to invest appropriately to maintain the safe and efficient operation of our core assets."", ""Now, beyond that, I would look to and I think we would look to allocate capital to the highest risk-adjusted return opportunities available to us.

1574,James C. O'Rourke,"[""First of all, let's talk about Chinese exports and what we think of Chinese exports, and I'm going to leave this to Corrine to really talk about. But at a high level, we do see active things by the Chinese government to reduce both water and air pollution and particularly to reduce pollution along the Yangtze River. And those are now starting to take effect and they're increasing the cost to produce phosphates in China but also reducing the overall availability of Chinese phosphate."", 'So, with that, let me hand that one to Corrine, and I will come back to the cash flow question.']",question_answer,MOS_142769
1575,Corrine D. Ricard,"[""Thanks, Joc. We are seeing a decrease in Chinese export. While we've seen a small increase year-to-date, January through September, in those DAP exports, the MAP exports are off very significantly, about 23%. And that really is a result of what Joc was talking about with the environmental pressures happening on producers. There are a number of things happening in the environmental area, and that's what we've been talking about for a while on Chinese exports."", ""The first is that there are taxes that have been levied against the producers that are adding $10 to $15 a tonne in their operating costs because they have to pay tax against the environmental pollution. The second thing that's happening is higher operating costs, so there is a significant reduction in rock mining because the government has disallowed mining in some environmentally sensitive areas. And so, the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics reports that phosphate rock mining is down 30% through September. So, you have producers that used to be integrated with the rock mines are now nonintegrated producers having to purchase rock from others and rock prices are up significantly. We're also starting to see the start of rock imports into China, indicating a shortage of that raw material."", ""And then lastly, I would say, there are significant capital costs at risk here as well. You've got plants that are within the 1 mile region on the Yangtze River are being forced to relocate and some that are a little farther out from 1 mile are being told that they have significant capital they have to spend to manage their gypsum differently and handle other environmental pollutions differently. So, we believe – and the timing on those changes and those plant relocations is by the end of 2019 and then some by the end of 2020 for the capital investment. So, we really believe that there will be a watershed year here in 2019, 2020 on the environmental impacts affecting these Chinese producers and we expect exports will be down. Again, we're carefully watching these exports, and if you take a rolling 12-month look at exports, they are down about 11%."", 'Mike, anything you want to add?']",question_answer,MOS_142769

Obviously, the bottom line is what we're seeing is we're seeing stuff on the ground, and these higher prices are driving probably some higher utilization and plants may not necessarily have otherwise been running at this time. Now, we're going to move on to the question – I'm just going to rephrase this a little bit to make sure I've got it right. But if I heard you correctly, cash flow from receivables is actually up by two months this year and you were asking us to clarify what is the impact of the Brazil prepayments on our cash position.

1579,Clint C. Freeland,"[""Yeah. Thanks, Joc. So, I'll start with the Brazilian prepayments. Those prepayments, at the end of the second quarter, were about $500 million in cash, and where you see that on the balance sheet is in the cash balance and in our payables. And when that reverses, what you have is it almost gets transferred from the balance sheet, goes to the income statement where that $200 million reduction in prepayments comes out of the cash balance and then flows through your P&L. And then, to the extent that you have no margin on those sales, which obviously you do, that would then come back for the cash flow statement onto your balance sheet. And so, net-net, you'll have a reduction in overall cash balance for those prepayments, but not the full $200 million because you'll end up with the margin on your balance sheet."", ""I think the other part of your question was around receivable and payable balances, and one of the things that I would – I assume that you're looking at our balance sheet. Recall that we closed on our acquisition on, I believe, January 8th. And so, the effect of the acquisition and bringing the working capital balances onto the balance sheet is part of that delta. As you look at the quarter, in particular, I would say that from a receivables standpoint, we had pretty high sales in September in North America, in particular. And so, that would have been booked into receivables that should again turn in the fourth quarter. So, that would be the story around receivables. I think payables, nothing really out of the ordinary there. I think it's just a matter of timing of various accruals and other things throughout the year.

Do you not expect any demand destruction from India's rupee depreciating, rising phosphoric acid prices and the higher MRPs which are all impacting affordability?

But in any situation, and next year, I believe, is a situation where we're going to be somewhat supply-constrained in terms of growth. I think, then, at some point, you do have to ration ultimate supply. And so the least affordable markets will have to ration their growth. And I think that is something that could happen depending on price movements in India, but it will only be because of those price movements. So there's obviously some sensitivity to both currency and prices in a market where their product is not sold on the international market but sold at a controlled price in country."", 'Corrine, do you want to talk about that a little bit, please?']",question_answer,MOS_142769

And they have adjusted their MRPs several times throughout the year. And at each level, we're continuing to see farmer purchasing.

In fact, Bolsonaro was officially endorsed by the Agricultural Parliamentary Group during the elections. So, that is a positive from an agricultural perspective. However, in Brazil, to make things happen, you really have to build coalitions so it's a little early to see.

If you recall, a lot of our revenues there are dollar-based and our expenses are BRL-based.

But when we look at – there's been a series of either call it supply disruptions or supply changes that have probably taken a good 0.5 million tonnes out of the market. So, as you know, the ICL closed their Boulby mine midyear. SQM is maximizing the amount of lithium they produce versus potassium chloride. K+S had production problems at its Werra Complex with low water levels in adjoining rivers, and so forth. So, you add that up, there's about 500,000 tonnes of lost production. Next year when we look at this, K+S is going to close their Sigmundshall mine, which is probably 450,000 tonnes. The Boulby mine produced half of this year, so there'll be another half of year loss there."", ""So, when we add up 1.2 million or 1.1 million tonnes of demand growth, coupled with the supply changes that we see, we show a deficit of about 0.5 million tonnes.

1632,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion. I would like to start by welcoming Clint Freeland, Mosaic's new CFO, to the call. Clint has been with us a couple of months now and he is fully immersed in the business. Our results for the quarter reflect continuing improvements in business conditions as well as meaningful benefits of our many strategic moves, including the acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes and the transformation of our cost base across the company."", 'We would like you to take away three key messages from this call. First, Mosaic is generating strong cash flow, demonstrating both the resilience of our business and the earnings leverage we created. Second, we expect to deliver strong results for the remainder of 2018. And third, phosphates and potash markets continue to strengthen, and we believe they will remain firm.', 'For the quarter, net earnings were $68 million, or $0.18 per share. After adjusting for notable items, primarily non-cash items related to foreign currency changes, Mosaic earned $0.40 per share on sales of $2.2 billion, up both sequentially and year-over-year. We have also raised both the full-year adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share guidance.', ""I'll begin with brief observations on the market, starting with phosphates. If we look back a year or two, 2018 was expected to be a tough year for phosphates with several new production facilities coming online around the world and demand struggling to absorb the new production. What we're seeing today is a relatively tight phosphate market with strong demand offsetting the gradual ramp-up of new supply. It is worth noting that new greenfield projects take a long time to reach full production capacity. That includes our joint venture with Ma'aden in Saudi Arabia as it gradually works towards its stated capacity of 3 million tonnes annually. In addition, Mosaic's idling of Plant City and ongoing restructuring of the Chinese industry have further tightened the S&D with phosphate industry stripping margins now at their highest point in four years. That obviously is great for Mosaic, especially considering the 4.5 million tonnes of phosphate production capacity included in our recent acquisition in Brazil."", ""Mosaic's global network of analysts expects global phosphate demand to reach another new record next year, with 70 million to 72 million tonnes of shipments predicted. New supply will continue to gradually come into the market at a pace we expect will be challenged to keep up with growing demand. As a result, we expect the phosphate market momentum to continue into 2019."", ""In potash, the global supply and demand picture remains balanced and the prices are holding up well. Potash demand and producer shipments through the first half of 2018 continued a strong pace following last year's record-setting numbers."", 'Despite the recent drop in agricultural commodity prices, nutrients remain affordable and farmers are replenishing depleted soils after several back to back large crops. As we look ahead, we believe demand growth will be in balance with the new product that is coming to market over the next several years.', 'We are keeping our eye on a couple of factors. First, Chinese phosphate experts have fallen year-to-date, in part because of new environmental restrictions on industrial facilities in China. But as market prices and stripping margins rise and the Chinese currency weakens, producers there may respond by resuming higher export levels. Longer term, we continue to expect high cost Chinese producers to balance the market, which is a positive for Mosaic as a vertically-integrated producer.', 'Second, agricultural commodity prices are in flux. While we will continue to closely monitor these developments and assess their potential impact on global P&K shipments, at this point, however, demand prospects look strong in our two key geographies. Soybean economics are highly profitable in Brazil due to weaker reais and a record local basis.', 'In North America, farmers are expected to harvest another large crop about a month earlier than normal, and that means they will have ample time to replenish the record amounts of P&K taken out of the field this fall.', ""Now, I'll move on and provide some insight into our business segments. First, in the phosphates business unit, we generated gross margin of $67 per tonne, or $70 per tonne after notable items, more than double the same quarter a year ago. Margins obviously benefited from higher market prices for our product. Just as important, though, is the progress we are making towards transforming this business unit."", 'As an example, even with a significantly higher percentage of Miski Mayo rock consumed during the quarter, our phosphate rock costs remain below $60 per tonne. In addition, we had record quarterly sales of our MicroEssentials premium products. During the quarter, our margins were negatively impacted by costs associated with a once-every-five-year turnaround of our molten sulfur barge, as well as higher sulfur costs from using more prilled sulfur. These higher sulfur costs are expected to carry into the third quarter.', 'In the potash business unit, our gross margins improved sequentially with higher sales volumes offsetting the cost impact of weather-related logistics issues at the beginning of the year. As we discussed on our last earnings call, we experienced containment issues during the first quarter, and that impact flowed through the P&L during the second quarter. Production cost during the second quarter remained very well controlled, and prices inched higher which bodes well for our profitability for the remainder of the year. As a reminder, we will undergo several typical maintenance turnarounds during the third quarter which is embedded in our assumptions and our guidance.', 'We continue to make good progress at K3. We recently commissioned the overland conveyor and it will soon be tied into the K2 mill. All facilities are now in place to enter the production phase later this year. We plan to provide a more in-depth update on K3 at our next earnings call. Longer term, we expect to continue to drive unit cost down as we ramp up our Esterhazy K3 mine and eventually eliminate brine management costs at K2.', 'Mosaic Fertilizantes, our business in Brazil and Paraguay is also performing well. The previously published pro-formas showed the business was about breakeven on an adjusted EBITDA basis during the second quarter of last year. This year we generated $55 million of adjusted EBTIDA. Some of the improvement came from favorable currency exchange rates and higher phosphate prices. But much of the improvement resulted from the work we are doing to transform the business.', ""Our results in Brazil for the second quarter were negatively impacted by almost $40 million for both planned turnarounds and the nationwide truckers' strike in May. As a result of the strike, we idled production and lost shipment volumes, which caused us to miss our volume guidance for the quarter. In total, we estimate the strike lowered adjusted earnings by approximately $11 million before tax."", 'We are continuing to monitor the situation closely as the government and the truckers work to find a more lasting resolution. Regardless, we believe our position at the low end of the delivered cost curve gives us a competitive advantage in Brazil. The teams in Brazil are well ahead of schedule to achieve $100 million in net savings this year and $275 million by the end of 2020. They are executing several hundred projects from labor efficiencies to mine process improvements and increased chemical plant throughput.', 'Year-to-date, $56 million of gross synergies, or $34 million after cost to achieve have hit the bottom line. As an example, we are pleased to see that costs at our Tapira mine have already been reduced by almost 30% on a reais basis. While we believe it is likely we will achieve net synergies in excess of $100 million in 2018, there is still much to be done.', ""One of the key risks we continue to watch is the implementation of the government's published minimum freight rates. The entire Brazil team is energized and employee morale is very high as Clint and I saw firsthand during a recent visit."", ""It is worth reminding you that Brazil remains an extremely attractive agricultural market. Brazil is expected to surpass the United States in total soybean production for the first time this year and the market needs fit well with Mosaic's product mix. Brazil's primary crop of soybeans needs high levels of phosphate and potash."", 'A final point on Brazil. The weak Brazilian reais was a modest net benefit to us during the quarter. The benefit of currency devaluation are delayed as the changes impact the cost of production which are recognized when the product is sold. In addition, a proportion of these costs are hedged. In addition, we are close to fully hedged on the reais-based cash and net receivables on our Brazilian balance sheet.', 'Now, a note on capital. Our strong business performance in Brazilian customer prepayments are driving good cash flow. For the quarter, we generated close to $600 million in free cash flow. We are using some of our cash to pay down debt and work towards returning to our through cycle leverage ratio targets. In fact, with an additional $200 million of debt retired already in the third quarter, we have already achieved our target of paying down $500 million by the end of 2018.', ""Our capital priorities have not changed. We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and sustain our assets, and then we assess the best use of remaining capital given the opportunities we see, including investments and shareholder returns. In total, we are pleased with Mosaic's performance for the quarter. We are optimistic that we will deliver strong results for the remainder of 2018. Markets are strengthening and our execution is generating real financial benefits. That's why we now expect to be in the $1.8 billion to $1.95 billion range for adjusted EBITDA and in the $1.45 to $1.80 per share range for adjusted EPS this year. We have built a resilient business, and our many strategic moves position Mosaic to generate attractive returns as this market continues to improve."", 'Now, we will take your questions.

1634,Vincent Stephen Andrews,"[""Thank you and good morning, everyone. Joc, you mentioned the higher stripping margins potentially helping sort of keep some of Chinese capacity in the export market. How do you think about that vis-à-vis your capability to bring back Plant City which would, in theory, probably temper China's exports? So, obviously curtailing Plant City has had great impact on the market – very positive impact on the market, but how do you counterbalance that with maybe the Chinese capacity not going away as fast as we thought?""]",question_answer,MOS_138636
1635,James C. O'Rourke,"['Sure. Good morning. And, Vincent, good to hear from you.', ""Well, let me start by just giving you a little bit of our thoughts on Plant City, and I'm going to hand it to Corrine to just talk a little bit about some of these changes in China. And we do believe that with these higher prices, the changes will occur a little slower. We'll see higher utilization of some of the better environmental-performing plants and the less expensive plants. But overall, I think we believe the trend is definitely that China will slowly decrease their exports."", 'In terms of Plant City, the criteria for Plant City review has really not changed from last year. As you say, the thinking behind idling Plant City in the first place came from expecting to offset some of the new production that was coming on. Clearly that new production has come on a little slower than we would have expected or might have been predicted, but at the same time, we still fully expect that production will come on in the next couple of years. Some of that will be offset by growth in the market, but we also believe some of that is offset by our own reduction in capacity. So, with that, Corrine, is there anything you want to say about the Chinese market?']",question_answer,MOS_138636
1636,Corrine D. Ricard,"[""Sure. We still are seeing a lot of discussion about the environmental protection mandate that we've seen around the Yangtze River. The situation is still evolving, and our local team has been doing a lot of work to try and get updates for us regularly. They are reporting reduced rock production at some of the mines and increased cost related to the gypsum disposal and some producers are having real proximity challenges. They're too close to the river and they're being threatened with either closures or relocation to get a little more distance. So, that economic pressure in total on these producers is really starting to add up. We're seeing their cost structure go up and they're having to fully cover their costs and that's part of why you're seeing these higher asking prices on their offers for exports."", ""If you look at DAP, MAP and triple exports, they are down for the first six months of the year modestly, about 4% down. But it is starting to take effect. All that said, of course, with these strong stripping margins, it is really difficult to anticipate the pace of the restructuring.

1644,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Yeah. First impressions of Mosaic Fertilizantes, I think our first impressions have been that the opportunities were at least as good or better than what we had hoped for. We've seen an extremely energized team. Probably, the most encouraging perspective from my point of view is how energized the new Mosaic employees are about making the changes and really becoming part of the Mosaic team. They're very excited about being part of a group that's focused on crop nutrition and delivery of crop nutrition. So, that's really encouraging. As you kind of indicate, our synergy capture has been at least as good or better than what we could have hoped for."", ""So now let me come back to the Q1 earnings question in terms of – or, sorry, the synergy question. First half of the year, yes, we have $56 million of gross synergies. Net of cost to achieve though, we're more like $34 million, and we said we would achieve $100 million including net of the cost to achieve. So, two-thirds of the next year, we have or next quarter, we have to achieve about $66 million to the bottom line. And we're certainly running at a rate that will give us that."", ""And then, we're encouraged that we might do better than that.

In your China phosphate export data, what you show is DAP up about 10%, but MAP down by about a third and TSP is also up. What do you make of the decrease in MAP shipments but the increase in DAP shipments?"", 'And secondly, in the third quarter in your Brazilian operations, are there more turnaround costs or trucking issues or other cost inflation that you might note that would carry over from the second quarter?']",question_answer,MOS_138636
1647,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Sure. Well, thanks, Jeff. I'm going to hand the China question over to Mike, but let me comment a little bit about the – particularly the risks in the third quarter. Certainly, most of the turnarounds were in the second quarter, as we head into the main fertilizer season we need our plants to be running well and be in good shape, which is why we take the turnarounds outside of the quarter. In terms of the trucking issues, the big issue there from our perspective is that the strike that started, it really impacted second quarter and it will probably come a little bit into third quarter because of cost of goods, but we've certainly covered that in our guidance."", ""The biggest area of concern there is while the trucking tables have been implemented by the government, a lot of people believe that it is unconstitutional and anti-competitive. So, they don't believe that that was implemented correctly. So, the government is yet to find really what we'd call a workable solution there. So, the main exposure is from product sales, which include freight, and that we entered into before the strike. Now, in these cases, we still have uncertainty and don't have the kind of clarity we need for the implementation of that freight rate table. So, there is unknown exposure there which we have incorporated into our guidance."", ""However, there is also the risk because there is a lack of a clear resolution. There's always a risk of further disruption by the truckers. We don't think that's likely. But we do believe it is a risk and it's one risk that we can't really plan for because it is obviously an unknown. Hopefully, that helps. But generally, the biggest risk to Brazil right now, we've got a good book of sales on. It's just execution and making sure that that trucking works.""]",question_answer,MOS_138636

1650,Mike Rahm,"[""Sure. Good morning, Jeff. I think the numbers that you see in the first half are really indicative of the changes that we expect to accelerate in China over the next several years. One, the increase in DAP imports is driven largely by strong demand in India or a rebound in Indian imports this year, and that is being supplied by typically large integrated players who have more modern plants that are not located on the river and the like. The big drop in MAP production really reflects some of the economics of the non-integrated players that are mostly along the river where, as Corrine mentioned before, they're incurring higher costs and more stringent environmental regulations that are difficult to comply with. And as a result, we're seeing a 33% reduction in exports there. So, bottom line, I think it's just indicative of things to come.""]",question_answer,MOS_138636

When you lay that up against increases in capacity, in the case of phosphate, we basically see a deficit in 2018 first half. We think that deficit was close to 0.5 million tonnes for the year. It could be in that 700,000 to 1 million tonne range."", ""And what we've said in the past several earnings calls is that we're not saying the world is going to run out of phosphate.

I suspect some of the Redwater plant may be brought up by other production within the Nutrien group. I'm not sure of that, but it certainly indicates that there will be a need for more imports and those imports have not been coming into the U.S. market at the rate they might need to because of the discount that we're seeing at the New Orleans price. Over time, they will have to equalize those price to drive the redistribution of fertilizers from the Brazil market. So, in other words the U.S. will have to pay up or the fertilizer will go to the Brazil and other markets rather than the U.S. So, I mean, free market systems mean these have to work out over time and we think that's positive for the U.S. market."", 'Anything to add, Corrine?']",question_answer,MOS_138636

The only thing I would add on North America is that there's some really interesting things, I think, going on in the market.

So, in other words, we have a contract of affreightment at one rate, but the new table is at a different rate. So, the question is, do the truckers honor the old rate which they entered a contract with us, or do they try to achieve the new rate?

1700,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Laura. Good morning, everyone. Since you've all had ample time to review our results, I will keep my prepared remarks brief and at a high level so that we can get straight to your questions. Mosaic continued to execute well in the first quarter of 2018 and global markets for our products continued to improve."", 'Our financial performance for the quarter was impacted by weather and the underperformance of Canadian rail service providers. In both potash and phosphate, we came in at the low end of our sales volume guidance due to the late North American spring and the rail-related logistical issues. Including related production curtailment costs, these factors negatively impact the quarter by $0.07 to $0.10 per share.', 'For the quarter, several notable items resulted in earnings per share of $0.11. On an adjusted basis, Mosaic earned $0.20 per share on net sales of $1.9 billion, both up materially from the first quarter of 2017. We expect to recover most of the deferred sales volumes as the rail issues are resolved and global seasonal demand moves into full swing.', 'We have three key takeaways for this call. First, we expect strong business performance to continue throughout 2018 and beyond. In spite of an increase in our anticipated effective tax rate from 20% to approximately 30%, we have increased the midpoint of our full-year earnings per share guidance to reflect strong EBITDA growth, our confidence in the business environment and our ability to execute.', ""Second, the underlying performance of our three business units is continuing to reflect significant operational improvements. And third, we are making remarkable progress in transforming the Mosaic Fertilizantes business in Brazil and we're excited about the success our team has delivered in our first quarter of ownership."", ""Now, I'll start with the markets, which continued their steady improvement. While the late spring and much of North America has delayed planting and led to some doubts about the 2018 crop, farmers outside of the U.S. are generally enjoying good economic results. Brazil was a highlight, grower economics are excellent with stable commodity prices and a weakening reais. Potash and phosphate prices built on their momentum during the quarter. Strong on-farm demand and delayed purchasing in India, Brazil and other key growing regions is expected to provide extended price support."", 'It is important to keep in mind that prices usually move seasonally and cyclically. However, we expect no seasonal declines until much later in the year and we expect the cyclical trend to be positive throughout 2018.', 'In potash, prices have continued a steady ascent. For the quarter, our average sale price was $239 per tonne, which is up $45 per tonne from the mid-2016 lows. Global demand is strong. In fact, Canpotex is fully committed through June in spite of the lack of a contract with China. New supply continues to be delayed beyond prior expectations. And now, we believe prices will remain firm into the second half of 2018.', 'Phosphate prices and margins also increased during the quarter, once again belying the theory that supply coming to market in 2017 and 2018 would pressure margins. In fact, average first quarter stripping margins have increased year-over-year from $233 to $262 per tonne. Our actions to remove higher cost production have helped lead to a balanced supply/demand picture. Overall, market conditions are constructive as we expect demand in India and Latin America to increase.', ""Now, I'll move on to a brief discussion of each of our segments. First, the transformation of Mosaic Fertilizantes in Brazil is well underway and proceeding according to plan. As a reminder, we expect to achieve $100 million in synergies in 2018 and $275 million in annual savings by 2020. We are on pace to achieve those numbers with many efficiency-generating initiatives implemented, in process or in the queue."", ""We've already taken actions that will ultimately deliver $100 million in annual savings. It's important to note, however, that these savings will primarily flow through cost of goods sold and thus be recognized in later periods as inventory is sold. In 2018, we would expect roughly a third of the targeted savings to benefit earnings in the first half of the year and two-thirds in the second half."", 'Our second quarter gross margin guidance for the Brazil business considers several competing factors. On the negative side, we expect to take turnarounds during the second quarter, which will increase our production costs. We will see diminishing benefits of purchase accounting adjustments declining from around $30 million in the first quarter to approximately $20 million and we expect a seasonal shift to more sales of lower margin single superphosphate.', 'On the plus side, as I said, our business transformation is taking hold, which is leading to real efficiencies. Market prices and stripping margins have increased for MAP and the currency exchange has grown more favorable with the weakening Brazilian reais.', ""We've also modified our annual volume guidance for this segment because we missed some intra-segment eliminations. The change in guidance does not reflect any change in our expectations for the market or for our business. We are making excellent progress and we continue to have very positive expectations for the acquisition in Brazil. The region remains extremely promising for the agricultural industry. In fact, Brazil soybean production provides Mosaic with a good hedge against any ongoing Chinese tariffs on U.S. soybean and helps demonstrate the value of our strategy to build on America's powerhouse."", 'Our growing momentum in Brazil is the primary driver of our new higher full-year tax rate guidance. Put simply, we expect a higher proportion of our pre-tax earnings to come from Brazil than our previous guidance showed. In phosphates, the aggressive transformation of the business is driving material cost reductions without sacrificing our operational excellence or employee safety.', 'In fact, in the first quarter, we achieved several new daily production records at both our mines and our chemical plants as we strived to recover a portion of the lost production from idling our higher cost Plant City facility. Cash cost per tonne in Florida mined rock were $35 in the quarter, the lowest in several years.', 'Our sales volume came in near the low end of guidance range as a result of weather and logistics challenges. Our guidance for the second quarter reflects the expectation of continued high stripping margin and strong seasonal shipment volumes.', 'Finally, in the potash business, our costs and overall operating performance remain very strong. Shipment volumes were challenged by the significant rail backlog and, in fact, we were at or near containment at all of our mines for part of the quarter, which negatively impact production by approximately 200,000 tonnes.', 'To reiterate, demand exists for all that product and we do not believe that we have lost significant sales for 2018. It is just an issue of timing. Production costs per tonne were roughly flat with the sequential quarter despite the logistics-driven curtailments. Gross margins per tonne were above guidance as prices remained strong and our business mix was more heavily weighted towards higher priced granular product.', 'I should note that our results this quarter reflect the one-time impact of a change in the methodology Canpotex uses to recognize revenue. Under the previous rev rec standards, we would have recognized an additional 400,000 tonnes of sales in the first quarter. Our second quarter guidance reflects the expectation that more lower price standard product will be shipped in the quarter. Risks to our volume guidance include a longer delayed contract with the Chinese customers and persistent problems with rail transport in Canada.', 'Before I conclude, I would like to provide some insight into our capital philosophy. In essence, our approach to capital allocation has not changed. We seek to maintain a strong balance sheet and maintain our assets and then we use additional capital to grow the business and generate shareholder return. The past few years were quite challenging, but we were able to weather the storm while maintaining a strong financial foundation and completing the largest acquisition of our history.', 'Today with strong and improving market conditions and a considerably more efficient operating model, we expect to generate substantial cash and we expect to use that cash just as prudently as our track record indicates we always have.', 'We expect to be able to pay down debt so that we can return to our over time leverage ratio targets. In fact, we are now targeting to pay down $500 million of debt this year, up from our prior estimate and well ahead of the pace to reach our commitment to pay down $700 million of debt by the end of 2020.', 'To conclude, this was another good quarter for Mosaic even as we experienced some external challenges. We are on the right course managing for cost efficiency across the cycle while maintaining the ability to capitalize on opportunities that improving markets present and remaining constantly vigilant to growth opportunities, large and small. We are looking forward to a strong 2018 and beyond.', 'Now we will take your questions. Operator?']",management_discussion,MOS_134444

I think the best way to answer that is just looking at demand growth, some of the supply adjustments and what is the overall supply and demand balance that we see. We're projecting that demand for the main phosphate products grows about 1.2 million tonnes. And if you look at some of the supply changes, we've taken about 1.5 million tonnes offline with the Plant City idling. And when you look at the ramp-ups of capacity, the Jorf Phosphate Hub will produce a few more tonnes – hub number three will produce a few more tonnes this year."", ""The fourth hub, the startup of that has been delayed probably until the second half of the year. But you probably can squeeze maybe 900,000 tonnes or 1 million tonnes out of there. And then the MPC ramp up, I think we've indicated last time that in 2017 it produced about 477,000 tonnes. We think it will produce 1.5 million to 2 million tonnes this year, so there's an incremental tonnage there."", ""And then if the Chinese continue along this pace where exports are off 1 million tonnes, that basically results in about 1.5 million-tonne supply gap for 2018. And that's why going back to the previous question, we're not predicting that the world runs out of phosphate. But what we are predicting is that the supply and demand balance is such that you're going to have to see somewhat elevated prices and margins maybe to crimp a little bit of the demand growth, but also stimulate a little bit more supply coming from established producers, whether it's in the U.S. or other places.""]",question_answer,MOS_134444

By idling Plant City and optimizing our phosphate production assets, we effectively tightened the supply. And in spite of new supply coming on, we saw the industry benchmarks increase materially.

We are going to keep our prepared remarks at a high level today and allow plenty of time for your questions. Before we get into the results, I would like to take this time to welcome Tony Brausen, Interim CFO to his role. He has been helping me prepare for every earnings since I became CEO and is a valuable member of our leadership team.', ""Now let's move on to earnings, although we reported a GAAP net loss of $431 million, it does not reflect the strength of the underlying business. Reported results include a $458 million non-cash charge related to the new U.S. tax legislation. Going forward we expect the new legislation to provide cash benefits in excess of $200 million over the next five years. EBITDA in the quarter was 271 million up 36% from a year ago. Mosaic's enters the year with a strong quarter, and significant momentum, driven by important strategic decisions, strong operating performance and improving market conditions as we head into 2018. We would like you to take away three key messages today, first we continue to expand our record of successful strategic actions to during shareholder value across the cycle. Second, with the acquisition in Brazil now complete we are highly focused on achieving the savings target and business transformation we outlined in our last call. And third, business conditions improved markedly in 2017 and we expect momentum to continue this year. For the quarter Mosaic reported a loss of $1.23 per share, excluding tax related charges and other notable items, adjusted earnings with $0.34 per share on sales of 2.1 billion. For the year the company reported a loss of $0.31 per share with adjusted earnings net of notable item at a $1.09 per share on sales of 7.4 billion. Our solid financial performance was driven by improving market conditions but also by our cost reduction initiatives."", ""Last year we made important decisions to transform our business and those decisions are generating meaningful benefits. I'll review these quickly. We idled our Plant City phosphate facility in Florida demonstrating our commitment to optimizing production from our lowest cost facilities and removing 1.4 million tons of annual finished product from global supply."", 'Phosphate prices rose in response and our fourth quarter gross margin rate in the business unit expanded to $53 per ton from $34 a ton a year ago.', 'In addition, the phosphates business also embarked on a major transformation effort that is expected to lead to reduce costs, improved processes and further margin expansion. In the potash business where the transformation is further along, cost remained near historical lows while we produced at high rates to meet record global demand and we reduced our capital spending without compromising the safety of our people or the integrity of our assets. Taken together these costs and capital related decisions provided significant cash flow benefits and strengthened our ability to prosper. At the same time, we put capital to work to generate future returns.', 'We also made good progress on our major strategic initiatives, our Esterhazy K3 complex is nearing completion and we have produced the first meaningful tons of potash from the new facility. We expect Esterhazy to be amongst the lowest cost potash mines in the world as over time K3 will allow us to eliminate brine management expenses.', ""Our joint venture with Ma'aden the [indiscernible] phosphate complex is ramping production providing us access to low cost production and advantage access to India and other Asian markets and of course we completed our largest acquisition ever and we did so on terms that were renegotiated to benefit Mosaic by several hundred million dollars. The newly formed Mosaic Fertilizantes in Brazil and Paraguay makes Mosaic America's powerhouse with advantaged access to customers in key agricultural regions."", 'Our team is Brazil is off and running working to transform the business and deliver the $275 million in total synergies we revealed last quarter. We expect to achieve at least $100 million of those synergies in this year alone and that is after any cost to achieve them. In fact, we plan to exit the first quarter having already achieved $40 million of run rate synergies and we will be booking a charge associated with the cost to achieve those in this quarter.', 'Overall, we have made a great deal of progress in 2017, and we are not stopping there. We will continue to drive for efficiency improvements while maximizing the value of our asset portfolio all around the world. We have also continued to focus on our financial priorities which begins with maintaining a strong financial foundation. In the fourth quarter of 2017 we issued $1.25 billion of debt to finance the cash portion of the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition.', 'With our stronger business performance in 2017, the 411 million in cash from operations we generated during the quarter and our improved outlook for 2018 we are already making progress towards our targeted leverage ratio of approximately two to two and a half times net debt to EBITDA.', ""Under the renegotiated terms of the acquisition we transferred just over $1 billion of cash and we're also able to paydown $200 million of our outstanding term loan. During 2018 we expect to use our cash to paydown a total of at least $350 million which is halfway to our original debt retirement goal of $700 million by the end of 2020."", 'The overall message here is that we are on solid financial footing and we are well on our way to making Mosaic efficient and highly competitive on a global scale regardless of the business conditions.', 'Before I conclude I want to provide a brief update on market conditions. Potash and phosphate prices have been low for several years in large part because of expectations of significant new capacity. Now as those new tons begin to come to market prices have moved upward due to two primary forces, first global Potash and phosphate demand has continued to grow and our market analysis team now expects another record year for global shipments of both products. Demand has been resilient due to positive and economic factors.', 'The second factor driving fertilizer prices higher is that new capacity has delivered fewer tons on expected. And those tons that are coming to market are being offset by higher cost production that is been idle or permanently stopped.', ""Markets fundamentals were quite strong for the first half of the year and with the many actions we've taken to solidify the business we believe our performance will continue to strengthen in 2018. We have simplified our guidance to better align with our new segments and for the first time we are providing annual earnings per share guidance. We expect annual adjusted earnings per share in the range of $1 to $1.50. The wide range at this early stage in the year reflects the inherent uncertainty and the timing and magnitude of changes in market prices for our products, which provides both opportunity and risk to our forecast."", 'Our two primary areas of focus are first, ensuring that we continue to operate efficiently and second, capturing Mosaic for [Indiscernible] synergies. We are also watching Brazilian reais and the Canadian dollar exchange rates given the impact they have on our profitability. Our industry and our company have enjoyed an enormous amount of change over the past several years.', 'At Mosaic, we took advantage of market conditions as they changed and we have made and are continuing to make structural improvements to strengthen the company for the long-term. One area that will not change, we will continue to operate responsibly with integrity and the highest degree of FX and we will maintain our commitment to our many constituents.', 'Our customers who serve those needs, shareholders, employees, our communities, non-government organizations and the governments because the sustainability and prosperity of this enterprise is important to all those constituent groups. I make this point because it is easy to lose sight of the big picture and challenging time.

1776,Joc O'Rourke,"['Well, good morning Vincent thanks for your question. So let me start by saying the expectations that we are guiding to are what we expect for the combined business of what is now Mosaic Fertilizantes which is our distribution business and our wholesale or B2B businesses we’re calling at and I am going to let Rick talk a little bit about volume expectations and what not, but let me start by saying we are very excited about where this business can go, Rick and I where there last two weeks ago, touring the sites and we just see so much opportunity there that we’re pretty excited. As we look at the places where we see those opportunities to add value, we believe we can drive real efficiencies across the mining processing and support functionaries the normal kind of synergy areas.', 'The one we don’t talk much about, you don’t hear too much both those as we see huge opportunities in our go-to-market strategy as well and what we can do there, I’ll give you a couple of examples here and we’re also making I think really good progress towards the $275 million and including in that is we expect a $100 million of net benefits this year. So that’s net of any cost to achieve them. And we’ll be as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we will be actually having an allowance for that in the first quarter.', 'But let me just give you a couple of good examples of where we’re going with that. First of all, we see a $24 million achievement already basically booked for this core first quarter on labor, we’re going to have about a $9.4 million benefit on equipment reduction and equipment optimization in the gypsum area the rethinking about gypsum strategy will net us approximately $3 million to $3.5 million per year. And one that you won’t comment [ph] are synergies, our rethinking of our strategy around pricing and marketing of seed will probably net us in the range of $20 million per year starting this year.', 'So, we got a lot of things on the go and I’m very confident that we’re going to hit our $100 million this year and our $275 million in the next. Before I give it over to Rick, I just want to remind you of one other thing which is we renegotiated this deal at the end of last year and part of that was due to the underlying, underperformance of the business in previous years.

On the production side, I think the target for us this year is around 4 million tons of PNK production.', ""Last year there were some issues with production here on the Vale Fertilizantes side and we’re working to effects. Jack, the only thing that I would add to your comments about the changes that we're making and things that are going on, is we've done something here with all of our employees in engaging them to identify areas that we can save.

Interest expense of course you'd expect that to be up year over year because we issued the debt late last year, tied to the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition."", ""So, we expect that interest expense to be up but still under a $200 million level. The other operating expense number, we're calling that what you often see in other operating expense are the notable items that we report and the $1.00 to a $1.50 is exclusive of any notable items."", ""So, you'd expect that other operating expense line in your model to be about you know what you'd typically see with no unusual items and so that would probably be in about the $40 million range.

In 2016, exports were about 9.5 million tonnes and actually were 10.1 million tonnes last year according to custom statistics and basically as such the market needed those tonnes, and as Corrine points out there're real changes taking place this year, and we will admit that we jumped the gun a bit last year and called it a little bit early, but the bottom line is we think there's a very good likelihood that exports do drop this year and if that happens, that's just fuel on the fire, in terms of the S&D balance.""]",question_answer,MOS_129973

1833,James C. O'Rourke,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings discussion. Our business performed well in the third quarter, notwithstanding, the impacts of Hurricane Irma on our phosphates operations. Potash and phosphate sales volumes remained strong driven by continuing strong global demand and our margins improved as a result of lower production costs.', 'For the quarter, Mosaic earned $0.65 per share including a benefit of $0.22 from notable items. Rich will add additional commentary and review our third quarter financial performance and fourth quarter guidance.', ""So, let me start off by focusing on some significant actions being taken by Mosaic. We are implementing a number of important decisions to improve Mosaic's profitability and cash flow. Simply put, we are taking actions to make this company as competitive as it can be in any business environment. Our primary focus areas are: first, we intend to transform our phosphate business as we continue to leverage our global leadership position and focus on improving our profitability as new capacity comes online."", 'Second, we are executing our plans to build our new shafts at Esterhazy K3 driving costs lower and ultimately eliminating brine management costs in our potash business unit. Third, we are planning to implement significant synergy and operational improvements in our fully integrated operations in Brazil after our pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition closes. We believe these actions, combined with the dividend reduction will allow us to achieve our long-term balance sheet targets by the end of 2020.', ""I'll provide some detail on each of these, starting with the phosphates business, where we are taking action to optimize our asset portfolio. We have decided to idle our Plant City, Florida concentrate plant, effective as of the end of 2017, for a period of at least one year. Plant City has the capacity to produce up to 2 million tonnes of finished phosphate products on an annual basis. This decision is similar to the moves we made to optimize our potash assets a couple of years ago. Those moves had the desired impact of lowering overall business unit production costs, reducing capital requirements and making Mosaic more competitive in the global marketplace."", ""We are making the move in Florida for several reasons. First, Plant City is the highest cost facility amongst our Florida operations and it requires a disproportionate amount of sustaining capital each year. As a consequence of idling Plant City, we will be able to optimize our future capital investments and we can increase production at our most efficient Florida operations to offset a material portion of Plant City's output, should the market need more tons. We expect that idling the plant will improve our phosphates gross margin rate."", ""Second, this move demonstrates the benefits of our global footprint. We will continue to deliver to our global customers and we'll do so with a lower cost profile. As our Ma'aden joint venture ramps up, we will be able to serve our distribution business and other Indian customers more effectively from a logistical perspective while generating higher margins."", 'Additionally, we will focus our U.S. production on our customers in the Americas where we have a logistical advantage. We are idling Plant City rather than permanently closing it, because we want to preserve the optionality to recommence our production when market conditions warranted. We continue to believe that supply and demand scenarios for phosphates is constructive, with demand growth essentially absorbing new supply additions.', 'Next, our potash expansion at K3 is expected to begin producing tons next summer and that will give us opportunities to further reduce our potash operating costs. The project remains on schedule and on budget. We are currently constructing the conveyor belt to deliver ore to the existing K2 mills and we are lowering mining machines to the potash seam, which is in the early stages of being built out for mining activities.', ""Over time, we expect K3 to be among the lowest cost potash mines in the world and it will allow us the additional benefit of eliminating brine management expenses that have historically been $150 million a year. In South America, as we move closer to completing our acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes, we believe we will have substantial opportunity to drive costs lower and improve the operating performance of Mosaic's combined business in Brazil and Peru."", 'Our sizable distribution assets the Miski Mayo joint venture and the upstream mining and production assets Vale Fertilizantes. We are preparing to transform the business which will drive substantial cash flow benefits beyond the synergies that we originally announced. Specifically, we expect to achieve at least $125 million in synergies, an additional $150 million in productivity improvements and at least $25 million in cash tax savings on an annual basis by 2020. We believe we can deliver $100 million in cash flow benefits in 2018 alone on top of organic business performance.', 'We have plans to achieve these targets spanning the entire value chain, focusing on operational efficiencies, our commercial strategy, raw material sourcing, procurement and other savings categories. We remain encouraged by the long-term promise of the acquisition which will bring us high-quality assets that are ideally situated to serve the very strong Brazilian agricultural market.', 'Finally, we are making additional moves to strengthen our balance sheet and preserve cash. In the near-term, we intend to pay down debt to return to our targeted long-term net debt to EBITDA ratio of roughly 2.5 times. As a result, we have reduced our annual targeted dividend to $0.10 per share. This move will save us approximately $200 million per year. We continually analyze all of our uses of capital in light of business conditions.', ""Once we've returned to our target balance sheet ratios, we will revisit our dividend from this base. Our asset optimization review is ongoing and you can expect that we will make additional decisions that makes sense to maximize our operating efficiency and improve our profitability and competitiveness even as market conditions continue to improve."", 'With that, I will turn the call over to Rich Mack for his commentary, including the third quarter and market conditions. Rich?']",management_discussion,MOS_125270
1834,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you all. As Joc noted, our business performed well in the third quarter. I'll start with the Phosphate segment. Global demand remains strong as farmers seek to replace nutrients removed from the soil by large crops in most of the key growing regions of the world. Margins have been stable with the expectation of additional supply, healthy mead high demand. As we previously announced, Hurricane Irma impacted our phosphate operations in Florida. The combined effect of lost production time and damaged product resulted in approximately 220,000 tonnes of lost sales during the quarter."", 'The storm tempered what was otherwise a very strong operating quarter for that business unit. In fact, for the first two months of the quarter, as you can see on the slide, the business operated at a gross margin rate of approximately 12%. The cost impact from the hurricane during the month of September was approximately $35 million with $26 million being realized in the third quarter bringing down our gross margin rate for the quarter to 9%.', ""I would note that our phosphates team did a heck of a job in preparing for and dealing with the challenges that presented themselves during this period, which resulted in about a week's worth of downtime in our plants. I want to highlight the performance of our premium MicroEssentials product. Our MicroEssentials sales volumes are expected to reach another record this year, approximately 3 million tonnes and the margin compression we saw earlier in the year as expected, proved to be transitory."", 'So with respect to phosphates, we are seeing improvements and we expect the actions, Joc described to drive further margin improvements in the future, keeping in mind some of the near-term expenses that need to be incurred to effect these changes.', 'Turning to the fourth quarter, we expect phosphate shipping volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million tonnes to 2.6 million tonnes and we expect prices to be in the range of $320 to $350 per tonne. Our gross margin rate for the business is expected to be in the upper single-digits, including the estimated $9 million negative impact from Hurricane Irma, which will flow through inventory costs in the fourth quarter.', 'During our last quarterly call, we reminded you that our ammonia supply contract with CF Industries takes effect this year. At the current market price of natural gas, we expect to pay approximately $330 per tonne FOB Louisiana and we plan to take about 200,000 tonnes of ammonia in the fourth quarter of 2017. These purchases will flow through our reported gross margins with about a one quarter delay, just like our other ammonia purchases. While the contract is underwater now, it was intended to generate shared producer economics over time, which remains our expectation. The contract provides us with reliable ammonia supply and protects us from volatility in nitrogen prices.', ""Turning to the Potash segment. We continue to generate respectable margins as a result of well managed costs and improving price realization. Global potash demand remains strong as evidenced by the fact that many of the world's largest suppliers, including Canpotex are essentially sold out through the remainder of 2017 according to published reports."", 'For the quarter, our sales volumes and prices came in near the top end of our guidance ranges and the business generated a gross margin rate of 21%. I want to emphasize the tremendous progress we have made on costs in this business. We took down higher cost production several years ago and to be sure this has had a real impact. But we have also made a wide range of innovative operational improvements and that is a testament to the hard work and creative thinking across our potash team. We look forward to applying a similar playbook to our phosphates business.', 'During the quarter, we also recorded a $10 million charge comprised of a $40 million royalty expense, partially offset by a $30 million Canadian resource tax benefit, highlighted in the notable items table, related to an expected Canadian royalty resolution. The net cash impact is positive since we overpaid the province to avoid penalties and we will be collecting approximately $20 million in refunds in connection with the resolution of the matter. MOP cash cost per tonne were $101 and included $21 per tonne of expense for the royalty resolution and $15 per tonne of cash brine management expenses.', 'For the fourth quarter, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.9 million to 2.2 million tonnes and we expect prices to be in the range of $175 to $195 per tonne. The gross margin rate is expected to decline to the upper teens as a result of a higher proportion of higher cost Colonsay product flowing through the P&L during the quarter. And as a reminder, we made the decision to push out our Esterhazy turnaround to the fourth quarter earlier this year.', 'In the International Distribution segment, our volumes and margins were at or above the high end of our guidance range, with third quarter being the seasonal peak for Brazil. We expect good performance in the fourth quarter in line with normal seasonal patterns. Sales volumes are expected to be in the range of 1.5 million to 1.8 million tonnes and we expect a gross margin per tonne of approximately $20.', 'Moving on to full year guidance. We are further reducing SG&A and brine management expenses as a result of our ongoing focus on cost management. Other changes to full year estimates can be seen on the slide. In addition, after quarter end, we completed a lease finance transaction for the ammonia barge which resulted in a cash benefit of approximately $200 million.', 'I also wanted to specifically address the underperformance of Vale Fertilizantes for the first nine months of 2017 and how Mosaic is viewing this challenge. Clearly, neither Mosaic nor Vale is happy with the reported results for an operation which historically has delivered significantly better performance. While there has been some turbulence in the phosphate sector in 2017, we absolutely believe that this business is strategically core to Mosaic and we are optimistic about its future, especially when viewed through the medium to long-term lens.', ""We engage in a business that has been and likely will always be subject to cyclicality and we don't believe that 2017 should be viewed as an indicative year for this business. I can provide some examples. For instance, there are several unusual items impacting Vale Fertilizantes results, including major movement in the Brazilian reais, flooding at Miski Mayo, a plant fire at Uberaba, incentive compensation expenses tied to the iron ore performance, which obviously is faring better than fertilizer and operational costs that have been materially higher this year that should be transitory in nature. We believe that this base business being acquired should generate approximately $300 million in annual EBITDA when viewed on a through cycle basis prior to synergy capture and operational savings. The fact of the matter is that Mosaic is in the business of producing and selling fertilizer and Vale is in the business of running a successful iron ore business."", ""We intend to approach the integration and roll-up of Vale Fertilizantes with an appropriate sense of urgency and apply Mosaic's operational model to accelerate business performance. Since we announced this transaction in December, we have been working diligently with world-class integration and consulting firms to identify and prioritize actions that can be implemented that are expected to drive significant positive financial improvements through this acquired business."", ""Finally, I would like to reiterate Joc's message regarding the strategic moves we announced today. We are making these difficult decisions that have real impacts on many of our employees to make Mosaic as competitive as it can be regardless of where we are at in the cycle and part of that is improving our cash flow and reducing leverage. These moves will lead us to meaningful improvements in our financial performance and cash flow, which in turn will help us achieve our long-term capital management objectives."", ""With that, I'll turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts.

We spend probably $0.5 billion in Brazil in the combined business on freight and that will – we expect to by working on lower freight rates of the combined business and utilizing backhauls, we can save about $8 million.', ""Likewise on rail, the Mosaic distribution system will now have access to the TIPLAM port and the VLI rail system. We can save $12 million there. Raw materials, sulfur, ammonia and limestone, by combining our two companies buying power, there is about $12 million.

And with the idling of Plant City, if you look at our 10-K, that plant has produced about a 1.5 million tonnes over the last three years or so. So, you have about a 2.8 million tonne hole to fill. And if you look at the new capacity that's scheduled to come on stream next year, we believe Ma'aden will probably produce 1.5 million to 2 million tonnes and the fourth hub that comes up, probably I think OCP has indicated that will not come up until the first quarter, so call that a 0.5 million to 750,000 tonnes. That gives you about 2 million to 2.75 million tonnes of potential new supply to fill that hole."", 'So I think in the best case, there will need to be a few more tonnes coming from the rest of the world.

Let me just say at the onset, our demand forecast for China do not take into account any of the recent developments related to biofuels. And I think that's a big uncertainty that we continue to examine. If they develop as much biofuels capacity as they have indicated, I think that's a bit of a game changer in terms of demand. So, let's put that aside and just look at how we see demand evolving. In the case – and in the two different situations in our view, we're projecting I mentioned 3% compound annual growth rates for potash."", ""And we think China will be among the leaders of the pack, because China still does not use enough potash relative to nitrogen and phosphate. So, as they attempt to achieve better nutrient balance improvement in nutrient use efficiency, expanding their production of oil seeds as well as feed grains, we think there's upside in terms of Chinese potash demand. And in fact, we have that growing essentially I think it's in that 2% to 3% range."", ""In the case of phosphate, we think it may be a little bit different in the sense that China has developed a big phosphate industry, they use a lot of phosphate. And as a result, we have a bit flatter outlook for phosphate demand in China. As I said, if there is a biofuels development that all could change and certainly with higher support prices for various crops and whatnot that could happen. So, China is a good growth engine for potash. We think it's a very big stable force for phosphate long-term.""]",question_answer,MOS_125270

Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion.', 'Mosaic delivered sequentially improved earnings for the quarter, as the business environment played out much as we expected it to. Mosaic earned $0.28 per share, including a $0.01 negative impact from notable items, on $1.75 billion in net sales.', ""We have three key messages for you today. First, our capital preservation and cost reduction efforts are yielding meaningful benefits. Second, we are making good progress as we plan for the integration of Vale Fertilizantes. And third, we are managing the business to capitalize on the long-term opportunity as potash and phosphate markets have stabilized and improve from 2016 lows. I'll provide some thoughts on these themes now, and then Rich will give you details on the quarter before my closing comments."", 'The market environment has improved. In Potash, published spot market prices today are up $40 to $50 per tonne from the lows in the third quarter of last year, while average phosphate stripping margins have increased $10 to $15 per tonne over that same period. As we expected, the market recovery has been gradual, and the cyclical trough has pressured our profitability and cash flow. We have taken far-reaching actions to adapt and to ensure Mosaic can compete across the cycle. In fact, a good portion of our revenue declines over the last several years have been offset by cost reductions and raw materials price declines.', 'We have achieved meaningful expense reductions. It is important to note that these are permanent reductions. We are not simply turning off the spending spigot for short-term gain. Our ability to lower capital spending is facilitated by substantial mechanical integrity efforts while maintaining operational reliability and safety. In fact, after substantial continued review, we have further lowered our CapEx guidance for 2018 and beyond by $50 million to approximately $750 million per year excluding Vale Fertilizantes.', 'As it relates to capital, we remain focused on maintaining a solid balance sheet and a healthy liquidity buffer. We also remain committed to taking the actions necessary to maintain investment-grade credit ratings. We are lowering costs, reducing brine management and capital expenditure requirements, and continually working to optimize our asset portfolio. One example of our continued asset optimization, last week we completed the sale of a significant vacant tract of land on the Mississippi River in Louisiana for $52 million.', 'When we issue debt to fund the cash portion of the pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition, our leverage ratios are expected to rise, and our subsequent priority will be to pay down debt and return to our through-cycle targeted balance sheet metrics. We remain bullish on the long-term prospects for Brazil. Upon closing the acquisition, we will add high-quality low-cost assets, and we expect to have a significantly amplified presence in the extremely promising Brazilian agricultural market.', 'Now I will turn the call over to Rich for his review of the quarter. Rich?']",management_discussion,MOS_121065
1910,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you all. This morning I'll briefly review our segment performance and guidance, and I will address some other factors that influenced our results for the quarter."", 'Starting with phosphates, shipment volumes and prices both came in near the top of our guidance ranges. Our phosphates gross margin rate at 8% was in the range of our updated guidance, taking into account the mechanical issue that occurred in March at our Faustina, Louisiana plant and the resulting impact on our cost of ammonia. The major turnaround at Faustina is completed. The final costs associated with the turnaround and ancillary startup issues are expected to have an immaterial impact on results for the third quarter and are included in our guidance.', 'During the quarter, MAP product premiums compressed against global benchmarks. Additionally, the North American market traded at a steep discount to global prices due to a high level of imports at New Orleans. While the MicroEssentials sales price relationships to MAP remain consistent, the decline in MAP prices negatively impacted expected MicroEssentials margins in the period. We expect this margin compression for both MAP and MicroEssentials to be transitory in nature. Going forward, we expect to continue to generate higher margins on sales of MicroEssentials and to capture an additional margin when we sell through our own distribution channel in Brazil.', 'I would like to point out a few other points of interest related to our phosphates business. First, the new ammonia vessel constructed for our use has been launched and is expected to begin regular trips across the Gulf of Mexico in the very near future. The vessel gives us logistics certainty and strategic flexibility, with deliveries of ammonia from CF Industries in Louisiana to a port near our operations in central Florida.', ""Our ammonia contract with CF is now in effect and expected to increase our ammonia costs in the fourth quarter. While the contract is under water at today's spot ammonia and natural gas prices, the contract was intended to provide us with shared producer economics, and we continue to see this contract as accomplishing that goal."", 'We have also increased our estimate of costs to repair the sinkhole at New Wales by $14 million because we determined that the void is larger than originally estimated. I want to note that the confining layer beneath the gyp stack has already been substantially sealed, and we are working to fill the remaining void to stabilize the existing plug.', ""For the third quarter, we expect phosphate shipment volumes to be in the range of 2.2 million to 2.5 million tonnes, and we expect prices to be in the range of $310 to $330 per tonne. In order to meet robust global demand, our operating rate is expected to remain high, in the mid-80% range. We expect the segment's margin rate to be in the range of 7% to 9%, primarily as a result of the temporary compression in MAP and MicroEssentials margins, as previously noted. We are also narrowing the full-year volume guidance from 9.5 million to 10.25 million tonnes to 9.5 million to 10 million tonnes for the year."", 'While we continue to expect that Chinese phosphate exports will be down this year compared with 2016, they remain a wildcard. Volumes are difficult to predict, but our estimate is that China will export around 9 million tonnes, down from 9.5 million tonnes last year and down from 11.6 million tonnes in 2015. Year to date, exports are up 26%, which we believe is driven by a combination of factors, including a poor domestic season, a jump in phosphate prices, and a desire to take what little cash margin is available before newly implemented export taxes and costs increase. Starting in 2018, we continue to expect that additional compliance costs related to the new environmental standards in China will put further pressure on Chinese phosphate exports.', 'Moving on to the potash segment, sales volumes and prices were in the middle of our guidance ranges, while our margin rate was slightly higher than guidance as a result of our ongoing cost control efforts. Market dynamics continue to strengthen, and the recent settling of a Canpotex contract with Chinese customers provided additional stability. While the contract price was at the low end of our expectations, it is good to have resolution because it helps demand emerge in other parts of the world.', 'In addition to driving costs out of our production operations, we are also reducing brine management costs as a result of investments we have made over the past several years. Our brine management processes are more efficient today, and we have been able to reduce spending as we look ahead to the K3 Esterhazy transition. We now expect full-year brine cost to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million, down from prior guidance of $160 million to $180 million.', 'For the third quarter, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.9 million to 2.2 million tonnes. We expect average realized prices to dip slightly to a range of $165 to $180 per tonne, primarily as a result of a shift in product mix as we recognize higher volumes of sales of standard-grade tonnes shipped to China.', ""We expect the segment's gross margin rate to be in the range of 15% to 18%, which reflects both the anticipated low 80% utilization rate and the stronger Canadian dollar. We expect to operate at lower rates in the fourth quarter after deferring some of the planned annual maintenance at our Esterhazy mine until October."", 'For the full year, we are narrowing our Canadian resource tax guidance to $90 million to $110 million from $85 million to $135 million, and we are also narrowing our full-year potash volume guidance to 8.1 million to 8.6 million tonnes, from 8.0 million to 8.75 million tonnes.', 'In the International Distribution segment, our volumes were within our guidance range, despite some deferred demand in Brazil. Our margins of $24 per tonne exceeded guidance as a result of a higher mix of our premium MicroEssentials products and price appreciation on inventories. For the third quarter, we expect international distribution volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, and we expect a margin to be in the low $20 per tonne range, assuming a Brazilian reais at current levels. Our full-year volume guidance is now 6.75 million to 7.25 million tonnes.', 'In the corporate segment, I want to note that the loss we recorded in the second quarter is primarily due to higher profit in inventory eliminations, which is largely the result of our own manufactured products sold to our distribution business to build up inventory in Brazil ahead of an anticipated strong third quarter. Profits are recognized in the manufacturing segment and eliminated in the corporate segment. Once that inventory is sold to a third party, we will recognize the profit in the corporate segment, so this is purely a matter of timing. As this inventory is being sold in the third quarter, we expect almost all of the negative adjustment to unwind and benefit consolidated gross margins. This swing reflects the normal seasonality in our business, combined with the fact that we only recognize revenue and profits when our products are sold to third parties.', 'Our tax guidance has also changed. We now expect our effective annual tax rate to be zero to slightly negative as a result of an increase in expected foreign earnings and a lower proportion of domestic earnings, as well as relatively constant depletion deductions. There is a high level of variability in our expected tax rate as a result of potential fluctuations in pre-tax earnings and mix of global income sources.', ""Before I conclude, I would like to note that we recorded $12 million in equity earnings from our Ma'aden Wa'ad Al-Shamal joint venture during the quarter. The earnings came in earlier than expected and resulted from strong sales of ammonia during a seasonally high period for ammonia prices. In addition, the Wa'ad Al-Shamal project has produced its first test tonnes of finished phosphate product, and we expect production to begin in earnest later this month. The project is likely to produce approximately 0.5 million tonnes of product later this year, with potential modest upside depending on how the ramp-up of the mega-project occurs."", 'To summarize, we remain focused on the things that we can control at Mosaic. We have driven major costs out of our system, and we are making prudent capital decisions so that we can succeed across the cycle and deliver shareholder value for the longer term.', ""With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks. Joc?""]",management_discussion,MOS_121065
1911,James C. O'Rourke,"['Thanks, Rich.', ""With all the challenges our industry has faced over the past few years and with companies' equity valuations at low levels, I can understand why many investors are less focused on the long term. But I think it is important to reiterate that we strongly believe that this industry will realize tremendous long-term value. Near-term, uncertainties remain, including trends in grain prices and new fertilizer capacity. New capacity comes to the market in big steps, and the capacity expansions we all started when markets were strong are bringing new tonnes when markets are softer."", ""But grower demand has persisted in a steady upward climb, despite tough farm and commodity economics. In fact, next year we expect another step up in global shipments for both potash and phosphates, with both nutrients achieving record shipments. That's driven by two factors that are not going to change. First, farmers have a strong incentive to maximize their yields and in turn, their revenue per acre, and balanced crop nutrition is required for higher yield. And second, the globe's demand for food will continue to increase. To put it simply, agriculture's increasing demand for crop nutrients will absorb the new supply over time."", 'Mosaic is in excellent position now, with our cost and capital controls delivering real benefits, and we are extremely well positioned to outperform when business dynamics strengthen. Our many moves over the past several years and our pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition create tremendous earnings leverage and opportunity for our shareholders.', 'Finally, we received notice that CADE [Administrative Council for Economic Defense] has approved our acquisition of Vale Fertilizantes, subject to a 15-day appeal period. There are other closing conditions that have yet to be made, but we continue to believe we remain on track to close later in 2017.', 'With that, we will take your questions.

1915,Michael R. Rahm,"[""All right, guys. Thanks, Joc. Let me give it the first shot. Just to reiterate what Rich said in the comments, year to date, exports are down 26%, about 800,000 tonnes – I'm sorry, they're up 800,000 tonnes. We expect that we'll end the year at about 9 million tonnes, which is down about 500,000 tonnes. So second half of the year we're expecting about 1.3 million fewer tonnes exported from China."", ""The reason for that is, one, we expect the domestic market to really kick in here over the next few weeks. The other factor is that I think there is increasing cost pressure in China. And we've seen an increase in sulfur prices. The Chinese producers do not necessarily have a competitive advantage in terms of sulfur prices or ammonia prices since they make most of their ammonia with coal, and coal prices have actually increased over the last six months."", ""And then I think the best evidence of that is there was an announcement this morning that the publications indicated that the Six Plus Two Group met. And surprisingly, they've taken their price floor up to $350 per tonne.

So obviously, the prices and premiums have had a negative impact, as you guided (21:03) in your prepared commentary. But you've also done some pretty good things on the operational side to help lower costs as well, so that should be helping the margin a bit. Just longer term, I know you probably won't be able to provide some more specific guidance. But just generally, could you help us walk us through the path or the timing in terms of getting back to maybe a mid-teens type of phosphate margin? Thanks.""]",question_answer,MOS_121065
1920,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Okay. Thanks, Andrew. I can probably hit most of this, and I'll just ask Mike to talk a little bit about the longer term. Look, the path to mid-teen margins really requires absorbing the new production that's going to come on in the next couple years. So there's probably 3 million to 5 million tonnes coming on, and we're absorbing that at a rate of almost 2 million tonnes a year, so in the next couple years there's going to be some absorption of those tonnes. But once you get past that, the market starts tightening up pretty well. And obviously, what the Chinese do matters. And if those tonnes go down, this could be a pretty tight market pretty quick, in which case we expect to return to more long-term mid-teen margins. Mike, do you have anything to add to that?""]",question_answer,MOS_121065
1921,Michael R. Rahm,"[""I can just briefly add. Just in terms of the five-year supply and demand outlook, we do think demand prospects remain very strong. We expect that demand will grow in that 2% to 2.5% range per year. And then on the supply side, we've always said that there's not a lot of new capacity in the pipeline once you get beyond Morocco and Saudi Arabia. And in fact, CRU just published their quarterly report yesterday. And just looking at those numbers, they're showing about 3.5 million tonnes of new capacity coming on, all of that from – basically all of it from Saudi Arabia and Morocco. We expect – and that assumes that China makes very few changes in their phosphate industry, and it remains to be seen how all that plays out. So when you add up 2% – 2.5% growth, once we get past this increase in capacity coming online here in the next year or so, and as Joc said, operating rates, we're projecting a 200 to 400 basis point increase in global operating rates, and that's not inconsistent with what the current CRU forecasts are.""]",question_answer,MOS_121065

1927,Richard L. Mack,"[""Sure, thanks, Joc, and good morning, Chris, nice to hear from you. A couple of things I would say on Vale Fertilizantes is first of all, strategically I think this is in the center of the play for Mosaic. It's a very important transaction for us. It gives us a very significant interest in the Americas, North and South America. It has lots of interconnectivity with our phosphate operations globally. And so we view this to be certainly a very strategic transaction that otherwise probably wouldn't have been available had we not taken advantage of the opportunity to enter into this agreement with Vale."", ""The second thing I would say is, if you take a look at the historical financial performance of this business, it's been very volatile, up and down. There are years where it significantly outperforms, and there are years where it can underperform, and I think 2017 is one of those years."", ""You referenced a financial metric which I'm not sure that I can verify concretely on the call here, but what I can say is there were a number of things that Vale needs to do before we close this transaction, which is likely expenditures of cash that they probably weren't otherwise planning for."", 'And secondly, you have seen a near-record strengthening of the Brazilian reais, at least in the last two or three years. If you go back 12 months, the reais was at BRL 3.8 – BRL 3.9, pushing BRL 4 to a dollar, and here we are today at BRL 3.1. And so that movement has got significant implication for the financial performance for Vale. And long term, if you take a look at what the prognostications are and what the fiscal condition is of Brazil, I think that I would take the bet that the reais likely is going to weaken, which should improve the financial performance for that business.', ""And then finally on synergies, what I would say is this. We've communicated $95 million in operational and tax-related synergies on an annual basis. We have been hard at it planning the integration activities. We have got a list of synergy opportunities that go on for many, many pages, and we are going to be driving that synergy capture very aggressively once we close this transaction.

First, we are continuing to manage our costs and capital carefully. Second, markets have moved upwards even if the pace of recovery has not been linear. And third, we have taken necessary and bold actions to position Mosaic to capitalize on better business conditions."", 'For the first quarter, Mosaic reported a breakeven earnings per share on $1.6 billion in net sales. Looking ahead, we expect improvements in our business unit and consolidated margin rate driving strong earnings in the second quarter. Our work to reduce cost continues to provide meaningful benefits. We are ahead of schedule on our 2018 goal to reduce costs by $500 million and we are well on our way to achieving the additional $75 million savings target that we announced a year ago.', 'You can see the progress in our SG&A expenses and in cash production costs, with potash costs remaining near 10-year low in spite of a mechanical issue at one of our Esterhazy shafts. In fact, total MOP cash cost per tonne for the quarter were $86 including $11 per tonne of expenses relating to the skip failure we had last month and $20 a tonne of brine management expense.', ""I want to emphasize two points on our expense reduction work. First, we're taking out costs across Mosaic in every business unit and support function. That requires innovative thinking from our employees every day, how to make processes more efficient without sacrificing safety, and they are delivering. And second, we are not going to take our eye off the ball as markets improved. We understand that being a low-cost producer is critical in this industry across the cycle."", 'In addition, our focus for the remainder of 2017 will be on integration planning for the upcoming Vale Fertilizantes transaction. As we said on our Analyst Day, we will continue to look for value-creation opportunities in the medium term, but first things first. We are giving the Vale Fertilizantes transaction a great deal of thought and attention so that it can achieve our strategic objectives.', ""Little has changed in the market environment since our Analyst Day, so I won't go through all of that in detail. Global demand remained strong, and we have narrowed our expected global shipments to the upper end of the ranges. I wanted to address one issue that is getting a lot of attention these days, Chinese phosphate exports. With economic and environmental pressures mounting on Chinese producers, we expect their exports to fall to somewhere around 8 million tonnes."", 'The recently released March export figures show a modest increase in Q1 exports compared to last year. First quarter represents a small percentage of the yearly cadence of exports, and we continue to expect year-over-year declines for the remainder of the year. Overall, while this quarter included some noise, Mosaic continues to make good progress, and the markets are giving us some momentum. We are executing our strategy and managing cost and capital. And we are in excellent position to thrive as markets continue to improve.', 'With that, I will turn the call over to Rich Mack.']",management_discussion,MOS_116862
1988,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thank you, Joc, and good morning to you all. Today, I'll briefly review our segment performance for the quarter and take you through the reasoning behind our second quarter guidance. In Phosphates, shipment volumes were at the top end of our guidance range due to continuing strong global demand and expectations of a strong spring application season in North America. Prices were in the middle of our guidance range and our operating rate was 79%, which was also in line with our expectations."", ""The Phosphates margin rate was below our guidance primarily due to an unplanned mechanical issue at our Faustina Louisiana ammonia plant where we experienced a failure in a converter two months before a planned turnaround. The plant was down for several weeks towards the end of the quarter, so some of the costs related to the downtime are reflected in our current quarter's results."", 'Additionally, we had to buy more ammonia on the spot market just after ammonia prices had risen significantly. The combined negative impact on gross margin was $14 million or 1.7 percentage points. The plant will complete its scheduled turnaround and is expected to be up and running by mid-May, so ammonia costs will continue to run higher in our Phosphates segment in the second quarter.', 'Our guidance for the second quarter reflects the higher selling prices we are seeing in the market today and robust shipments with continued strong global demand as well as higher operating rates. We expect the second quarter margin rate to increase compared to the first quarter, but we also expect that it will be negatively impacted by the higher ammonia costs I just reviewed and, to a lesser extent, the weather-related issues that have hampered our operations at our joint venture mine in Peru.', ""The western coast of South America has experienced record rainfall over the past two months which resulted in severe flooding that had major impacts on infrastructure and the people living in the area. The Miski Mayo mine, which was down for parts of March and April, is back to production now. As the weather issues played out, we and our joint venture partners have joined together to provide critical relief for the mine's employees and the surrounding community."", 'To ensure that we could keep our Louisiana plant running to meet demand, we purchased third-party rock. This was a temporary development and we do not expect long-term implications for rock supply or for costs.', 'For the second quarter, we expect realized DAP prices to range from $320 to $340 per tonne with volumes in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes. We expect gross margin to improve to approximately 10%.', 'As we get into the second half, we see a continuation of gradual improvement in Phosphate margins, as we realize the benefits of higher industry stripping margins, improving cost control and more normal operating rates at Faustina and Miski Mayo. The second half margins will also reflect purchases of ammonia under the CF contract as we expect to begin taking product in early September.', 'In the Potash business, our operating rates were lower than expected because of the incident with a skip at the Esterhazy K2 mine. K2 is back up and running now, but we expect the incident to reduce our second quarter shipments by approximately 200,000 tonnes. Our Potash shipment volumes were below guidance for this quarter because of a Canpotex train derailment and weather-related port loading delays. Approximately 150,000 tonnes that we expected to recognize in the first quarter have been recognized in the second quarter.', ""Our Potash gross margin rate fell short of our guidance. There are two main reasons for the shortfall in margin rate and margin dollars. First, roughly $22 million of costs associated with the skip incident were reflected in the current quarter's results. And second, lower than expected sales volumes due to the Canpotex-related logistics issues I just highlighted reduced per unit profitability. Otherwise, as Joc noted, our excellent cost control in the Potash business unit continued."", 'For the second quarter, we expect Potash shipment volumes in the range of 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes, with strong demand persisting. Prices are expected to rise modestly to a range of $170 to $185 per tonne, and margins are expected to improve to the low 20% range.', 'Moving on to the International Distribution segment, results were generally in line with our guidance. We sold 1.3 million tonnes of product and realized a gross margin per tonne of $21 in our international markets. International Distribution sales volumes are expected to be in a range of 1.4 million to 1.7 million tonnes in the second quarter, while margins are expected to remain in the $20 per tonne range. Our full year guidance ranges have not changed.', 'Beginning in 2017, we have changed our depreciation method from straight line to a units-of-production method for certain mining assets to more appropriately reflect the utility of these assets. The change in depreciation method to a units-of-production method is consistent with our peers and will be more comparable going forward. In connection with the change, with the increased focus on mechanical integrity and capital expenditures, we have taken action to allow us to operate our assets over a longer period of time and have extended the lives where appropriate. As a result, we expect an approximate $70 million non-cash P&L benefit in 2017 from a reduction in depreciation expense.', 'Before I conclude, a couple of notes on the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition. First, we are planning to issue debt to finance the cash portion of the purchase price in the late summer timeframe. And second, we expect to change our segment reporting post close. We will give you plenty of notice before our first reporting cycle under the new structure and we plan to provide adequate historical detail.', 'To summarize, we are continuing to focus on the things we can control. We are controlling our costs and we are making prudent capital decisions to ensure we can deliver strong shareholder value in the future. We expect meaningfully better results in the second quarter and the second half of this year.', ""With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks.

1996,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Okay. Thanks, Jonas, and good morning, as you started with. Look, let me start by saying, first of all, from our perspective, the Chinese contract is becoming less and less relevant over time. The Chinese makes up a portion of Canpotex's overall sales.

So, we see it as a less and less impact overall."", ""The other point I want to make before handing it over to Corrine is that the conditions are significantly different this year than other years when it's been delayed. This year, the reason for the delay, I think, largely is the suppliers aren't willing to make concessions. Asia is not waiting for China. You see the European prices are strong. Brazil prices have been strong. I don't think we're seeing the slowdown that we might have expected if China doesn't settle.

2003,Richard L. Mack,"[""Yes. So, Don, just a reminder, this is a producer-type sharing relationship that we have with CF and so there are going to be times where we're going to be in the money and there will be times when we are out of the money. And as Corrine just said, not long ago, ammonia prices were $40, $50 lower than where they are right now. And in that environment, we were probably out of the money relative to what we were going to be paying CF under the contract. But it's a very volatile market and, with that uptick, now, it's closer to parity is what I would say."", ""I think the bigger issue that we want to keep in mind here as well is we just are commissioning a brand new ammonia vessel and tug, and that's been a project that has been long in the works.

I'm not sure I fully understand your DAP price question, but I assume what you're probably seeing is the lag between when we actually book a sale and what you see as spot prices.

You're right, the guidance is right on the midpoint. But when you've got the seasonality, that Q1 sales included a lot of fill tonnes and a little bit for spring, and the Q2 guidance includes spring season as well as postseason.

I think the other issue is just the product mix that we talked about, even with MicroEssentials, that's a product that there's greater margin but more moderate prices associated with that, as well as some of the changes that have taken place in the feed market which also has been hurt pretty badly by the big surge of imports recently.""]",question_answer,MOS_116862

When you have assets that you shut down for a period of time, you're not reflecting the real rate of decline of the asset if you don't match your production rate with the depreciation rate. So, if you do a straight-line depreciation, it does not match well with the type of wear and tear that our actual equipment is exposed to.

Some of them did not change at all. And so, it really depends on what you're looking at."", ""I would say, when you take a look at how we went about reviewing this and the move to the unit of production methodology, we're probably still far more conservative than some of our peers are in terms of the useful life that we would assign to our assets.

They arrived late. And so, we're seeing a little bit of a price impact there. But up-country, the prices are holding quite a bit better than what you see out of the New Orleans market.

Rick McLellan is now Senior Vice President for Brazil. He will lead our combined business there after the transaction closes, and he is now fully engaged in the integration planning. Corrine Ricard has stepped into Rick's previous role, Senior Vice President of Commercial. Corrine most recently led our HR function and before that, she spent many years in senior roles in our commercial organization. She knows our markets and our customers extremely well, and she will be a valuable addition to our commercial efforts."", 'Before I get into the results, I want to briefly touch on the dividend action. As we previewed in December and as you have seen in our news release, we announced a reduction in the targeted annual dividend to $0.60 per share effective with our next dividend declaration. This move reflects our commitment to our investors to maintain a strong financial position, in light of the risk that the pace of market improvements is more gradual than we expect.', ""Now, let's get on to our results. This was a good quarter for Mosaic, with very strong shipment volumes and rising market prices for our products. We have three key points for you today. First, we had an excellent quarter from an execution perspective. Second, we are confident that the bottom of the cycle is behind us, and that markets are improving, albeit slowly. And third, Mosaic has managed our business effectively and invested wisely. As a result, we are in excellent position to capitalize on better business conditions going forward."", 'We are working to maximize the opportunities the Vale Fertilizantes acquisition will provide, while maintaining costs and preserving capital so that we can create long-term shareholder value.', 'We are optimistic about 2017. And we are definitely feeling better now than we were at this point last year. There is no question that business conditions are improving, and our execution has allowed Mosaic to fully capitalize on the upswing.', ""I'd like to point out some of the highlights of the quarter and of the year. In our Potash business unit, our MOP production cash cost per tonne decreased substantially, with costs for the quarter coming in at $56 per tonne. And cash production costs plus brine management costs were $74 per tonne."", ""The significantly lower costs were driven by a high operating rate at Esterhazy and by our now-complete Canpotex proving run at Belle Plaine, which is delivering volumes well above the mine's existing design capacity."", ""In addition, we have taken out meaningful operating costs through actions large and small, from stopping high-cost production to lowering our brine management expense. Fourth quarter results demonstrate the transformation of our Potash business. And we expect our cost profile to improve further when the K3 mine is operating and we have the opportunity to eliminate brine management expenses. While we're on the topic of K3, this month will bring an important milestone. We expect to reach the potash ore zone at 3,400 feet down in the next couple of weeks."", 'Our International Distribution business also continues to deliver high margins and good volumes, highlighted by very strong operating results in Brazil. Volumes in Brazil were up over 20% in the fourth quarter of 2016 and margins exceeded our forecast. The outlook for Brazil is strong, which bodes well for our pending Vale Fertilizantes acquisition.', 'On that front, integration planning is underway and we continue to expect to complete the transaction later this year. The Vale business is an ideal strategic fit for us. We will acquire excellent assets and a talented workforce at an appealing valuation. And the deal vastly increases our presence in the promising Brazil market.', 'In Phosphates, we drove down rock cost back to a more normalized level in the fourth quarter, and the team delivered record MicroEssentials production and sales in 2016, as we brought our expanded capacity online. I should also note that the teams in Florida have made tremendous progress on the sinkhole at New Wales. Grouting to repair the hole is underway. And we continue to see no offsite water impacts, as we expected.', 'Our Commercial team also executed well, with strong fourth quarter sales taking advantage of having our products in the right place at the right time. The team also met its significantly higher 2016 target for MicroEssentials sales, while maintaining the traditional premium over DAP, demonstrating the demand for MicroEssentials continues to grow.', 'We set another record for safety performance in 2016, our fourth consecutive year of record performance. I believe strongly that safety performance is an excellent indicator of overall execution.', 'Finally, our aggressive expense and capital management programs are paying off. Look at it this way; the year-over-year impact of potash and phosphate price decreases was $1.8 billion. Our lower costs and capital expenditures helped offset these declines. We generated $1.3 billion in operating cash flow, and maintained the financial strength to seize a major growth opportunity in South America.', 'I want to be clear. We are going to remain committed to the expense discipline we have developed across the cycle. Our guidance for 2017 demonstrates that. We expect SG&A cost between $295 million and $310 million, down compared to 2016. And we expect CapEx to be in the range of $800 million to $900 million again in 2017, down from our original expectations of $1.2 billion.', ""Now, let's move on to the markets and why we are increasingly optimistic about the year ahead. First, potash and phosphate prices continue to move up, even through the seasonally-slow time of the year. In fact, standard potash prices have risen $25 to $30 per tonne in Malaysia and Indonesia. A blend grade price has gained about $40 per tonne in Brazil and more than $50 per tonne in North America from their lows last year."", ""In phosphates, New Orleans' barge prices were up $35 per tonne since the low last December, while China export prices have surged about $70 per tonne so far this year. Second, the strong sales volumes during the quarter clearly helped establish some price momentum. Even with the high volumes, dealer inventories were low coming out of the fall in North America."", ""So, we continue to expect strong global demand in 2017. And, importantly, we have seen meaningful reductions in global capacity and production in both potash and phosphates. Of course, there is always uncertainties and we are keeping a close eye on grain prices, currency movements and China's phosphate production."", 'For more on our market outlook for 2017, I will turn the call over to Mike Rahm. Mike?']",management_discussion,MOS_112387
2058,Michael R. Rahm,"[""Thanks, Joc. Let's start with potash. We entered 2017 with very different fundamentals than just a year ago. Channel inventories worldwide have been drawn down as a result of continued strong on-farm demand and lower shipments during the last two years."", 'On the supply side, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of the industry cost curve have closed. We estimate a permanent reduction of approximately 3 million tonnes of annual MOP capacity from the closure or reconfiguration of seven North American facilities.', 'This, in turn, resulted in a large decline in output last year. For example, North American MOP production was down 2.1 million metric tonnes during the first three quarters of 2016, according to the most recent TFI statistics.', 'On the demand side of the equation, lower prices have underpinned strong on-farm demand. In North America, we estimate that shipments from producers and importers during the last half of 2016 were up 15% to 20% from both a year earlier and the seven-year Olympic average due to the long fall application window as well as a favorable ratio of crop prices to potash costs.', 'Reports from our sales team indicate that application rates held steady in most cases, and were up in others as some farmers are rebuilding soil potassium levels, given the low cost of potash. The net result is that potash inventories held by North American producers dropped 50% from the near-record 3.6 million metric tonnes on June 30 to just 1.8 million tonnes on September 30, according to the most recent TFI figures.', 'The improved supply-demand balance has driven the $50 increase in NOLA prices to $240 per metric tonne today. We expect this positive momentum to continue through 2017. Global MOP shipments are forecast to increase more than 4%, or 2.6 million tonnes this year, the first increase since the 9 million tonne surge in 2014. On-farm demand remains strong and producer shipments will need to closely match projected use this year, given lean channel inventories worldwide. All of the big six consuming regions, North America, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia, are forecast to post gains.', 'Finally, we do not expect material supply increases from either brownfield expansions or greenfield projects this year. All of this bodes well for potash supply-demand dynamics in 2017.', 'Moving to phosphates, as we said many times, China is the key swing factor and recent developments there look increasingly positive for the global market. Recent statistics and news reports indicate that the widely expected restructuring of the phosphate sector is underway. Production and exports declined last year, in response to both lower prices as well as the recent government crackdown on excessive emissions of air and water effluents. Chinese Customs Statistics show that exports of the leading phosphate products declined 18% last year, a drop of 2.1 million tonnes from the record volume a year ago.', ""The government reported that 70% of Chinese producers lost money last year, so lower prices are forcing cutbacks in output. In addition, some producers have temporarily shut down as a result of actual or expected environmental audits. The Chinese Government is becoming increasingly responsive to the public's demand for improved air and water quality."", 'As a result, we project that Chinese exports of the leading phosphate products will decline again this year to 7 million to 8 million tonnes. In addition, it is important to note that tighter environmental regulations and pollution taxes have and will impact even the low-cost producers, which, in turn, is raising the industry cost curve.', 'This is an evolving situation that merits close monitoring this year. Just like in potash, finished product prices have quickly reflected lower output and reduced product availability. The DAP price FOB China port recently traded at $360 per tonne, up $70 per tonne from just a couple of months earlier.', 'Looking ahead, global shipments of the leading phosphate products are projected to climb to 66 million to 68 million tonnes in 2017, up from an estimated 66 million tonnes in 2016. A key feature of the phosphate outlook is continued broad-based demand growth. In addition to expected gains in the big import markets like Brazil and India, significant demand is emerging from other regions, including Africa, Argentina, the former Soviet Union and Southeast Asia. Demand growth, combined with an estimated decline of Chinese exports, is expected to increase industry stripping margins from the lows of 2016.', 'In summary, prospects for the global phosphate and potash markets look positive given these recent developments. Prices are moving up and we expect that this momentum will continue this year.', ""Now, I'll pass the call to Rich Mack. Rich?""]",management_discussion,MOS_112387
2059,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. As Mike's views indicate, we expect stable and improving market conditions with continuing strong demand and the potential for a more constructive pricing environment."", 'We have been highlighting for several quarters that Mosaic is focused on the things that we can control, notably our execution, our operational costs and our capital. As our results demonstrate, we have made tremendous progress and, as Joc said, we are not going to take our eye off the ball as markets improve.', 'We are also going to continue to manage our capital very carefully. In December, we previewed a possible modification to our dividend policy, if market conditions did not recover sufficiently to fund our full dividend in 2017. Since then, market conditions have improved. And market sentiment is better today than it has been in the recent past. We expect this improvement to continue through 2017, but the risk is that the pace of improvement remains slow. With this in mind, we have consistently communicated our commitment to investors to maintain a solid financial foundation. And we have decided to reduce our dividend by approximately 45% to $0.60 per share on an annual basis.', 'Going forward, we will continue to manage our balance sheet to preserve our credit ratings, and we look forward to building from this revised dividend base as our business grows in the years ahead.', ""Now, I'll briefly review the quarter and the year, and I'll discuss our guidance for the business units. For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.03, which was negatively impacted by $0.23 of notable items. While there is some noise from quarter-to-quarter in terms of notable items, the impact for the full year was close to zero. In total, Mosaic earned $0.85 per share in 2016, a respectable result with the weak pricing environment our industry faced throughout the year."", 'In Potash, our sales volumes for the fourth quarter were at the midpoint of our guidance range, at 2 million tonnes. And prices moved modestly higher. The volumes reflect a continuation of the strong demand we saw in the third quarter, as well as the aftermath of a robust fall application season in North America. Strong demand leads to higher prices. And we are beginning to see that now, although our guidance is relatively flat in the upcoming quarter.', 'For the first quarter of 2017, we expect to see continued modest pricing gains in granular and standard markets, offset by contract-driven declines in our higher-priced industrial product as well as less industrial in the mix. The combined impact leaves our guidance for the quarter at $165 to $180 per tonne. We expect continuing strong demand as channel inventories remain low as we move toward a contract with Chinese customers.', 'Our volume guidance range of 2.15 million to 2.3 million tonnes is narrower than usual, reflecting the fact that 85% of our product is already sold. There is limited upside because very little product is available. The increase year-over-year is also indicative of the strong demand and lean pipeline inventories Mike mentioned earlier.', 'Our gross margin rate in Potash rebounded to 16% in the quarter, primarily as a result of our near-record low production costs. Our guidance for the first quarter margin rate is around 20%. While costs will remain tightly controlled, the restarted production at Colonsay and the completion of our Belle Plaine proving run are likely to result in slightly higher costs per tonne.', 'In Phosphates, volumes were above our guidance range as our customers took ownership of inventory to rebuild depleted inventories. Global demand has been persistently strong, with concerns over shrinking availability and rising raw material costs which have incented the channel to lock in product and drove average prices higher toward the back-end of the quarter.', 'With this as a backdrop, our first quarter guidance for Phosphate volumes is 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes. And DAP prices, FOB plant, are expected to range from $315 to $335 per tonne. As of today, like potash, over 80% of our volumes are committed and priced. Current spot prices for finished phosphates are higher than our guidance range, and we expect to realize those higher prices in the second quarter of 2017. Our Phosphates margin rate for the quarter was 9%, which was at the high end of our guidance range. We expect a gross margin rate in the upper single digits in the first quarter, as higher prices are offset by higher raw material costs.', 'As Mike pointed out, stripping margins have compressed for phosphate producers in 2016. We do expect, however, a gradual recovery with the key factors to watch being Chinese production and exports.', 'Moving on to International Distribution, which continued to generate strong results as we closed 2016; excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand, highlighted by very strong MicroEssentials sales. Sales and prices were also strong in India, where we saw a good rabi application season, and in China, where potash inventories remain low.', 'Gross margin per tonne remained very healthy, at $31 per tonne, as prices rose and our teams managed costs downward. For the first quarter, we expect margins in International Distribution to be approximately $20 per tonne, down slightly from the fourth quarter, reflecting natural seasonality in our Brazil business.', 'Finally, the effective tax rate for the quarter was once again negative, due to relatively constant tax deductions and our lower taxable income. We expect our 2017 full year tax rate to be in the upper single digits, as a result of expected higher profitability and slightly lower deductions this year.', ""To summarize, the fourth quarter was a solid end to the year for Mosaic, considering difficult market conditions. We generated good cash flow, controlled our capital spend and cost environment, and made some difficult decisions that will position us well with momentum heading into 2017. Going forward, our expectations are that the cyclical upturn will allow us to pay down debt and achieve our target leverage ratios within reasonable timeframes. The prudent, but difficult, actions we've taken to conserve the balance sheet have put us in excellent position for improving markets."", ""With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A.

So, I'm wondering if as we move through the spring season this year and get into sort of the summer doldrums, do you think we'll sort of see the seasonality of the prices resume or do you think we're just sort of on a slow steady glide path through the balance of the year, regardless of seasonal demand?""]",question_answer,MOS_112387

But the second quarter, we're not catching up to people that want to charge distribution systems, that – and buyers that have been buying hand-to-mouth.

2124,James C. O'Rourke,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings call. This morning, I will give you an overview of our results, then Mike Rahm will discuss market conditions, before Rich Mack takes you through some details on our performance for the quarter. I will have some final thoughts before we take your questions.', ""The key concepts that we want you to understand from this call are: first, we anticipated improvements in the business in the second half of the year, and those improvements have begun to materialize. We continue to maintain a constructive outlook for the industry; second, the actions we've taken to lower costs and optimize assets combined with our scale and secure market access, positioned us to maximize the benefits of improving market dynamics; and third, our Brazil-centered growth strategy is clearly paying off."", ""Our investment in MicroEssentials capacity expansion and the acquisition of ADM's distribution business came together to allow our International Distribution business to meaningfully exceed expectations this quarter."", ""Now, let's discuss the markets. Mike?""]",management_discussion,MOS_184892
2125,Dr. Michael R. Rahm,"[""Thanks, Joc, and good morning, everyone. Markets during the third quarter played out close to our expectations. Let's start with Potash. Three positive developments are taking place in the global potash market: one, on-farm demand remains solid worldwide; two, large channel inventories are getting worked down; and three, producers are optimizing operations in order to meet demand and compete profitably in this new market environment."", 'On the demand side, statistics continue to point to a bunching of demand during the second half, exactly what we had highlighted on the last earnings call. Canpotex has announced that it is sold out for the rest of the year; its second half shipments are expected to top the 2014 record. We also project that second half North American shipments will rank as the second highest during the last five years.', 'As you can see on the slide, North American producer inventories are shrinking rapidly, as a result of not only this demand surge, but also production cutbacks during the first half, normal summer turnarounds, and the temporary closure of our Colonsay facility.', 'Current momentum is expected to carry over into next year. We project that global MOP shipments will climb to 61 million tons to 63 million tons in 2017, with the current point estimate of around 62 million tons. That computes to a 4%, or 2.5 million ton jump in shipments from our 2016 estimate of just less than 60 million tons. The projected increase is driven by continued solid on-farm demand and leaner channel inventories worldwide. Thus, shipments are expected to more closely approximate use next year. All of the big six consuming regions are forecast to post gains in 2017.', 'In the case of Phosphates, the DAP margin turned up during the third quarter, as a result of improved fundamentals. The benchmark increased, but the sharp drop in raw material costs resulted in stable or only moderately higher prices in most regions, and that is helping to fuel broad-based demand growth.', 'We estimate that global shipments will increase by 800,000 tons to 65 million tons to 66 million tons this year. China and India remain drags on growth, but gains from all corners of the globe are projected to more than make up the shortfall in the two largest phosphate consuming countries.', 'In addition to increases in the United States, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Pakistan, the former Soviet Union, and Africa are expected to post solid gains this year. Just like potash, several supply side changes are taking place.', 'China year-to-date exports through September are down 29%, or 2.4 million tons from last year. We project that exports will drop from a record 11.6 million tons in 2015 to about 8.6 million tons this year. A restructuring of the Chinese industry is widely expected, with publicly announced plans to close outdated plants with capacity of 3.0 million tons of phosphate capacity by the end of this decade. That is the equivalent to 12% of industry capacity, or 6.5 million tons of DAP, roughly the amount of new capacity expected to start up in Morocco and Saudi Arabia during the next year or two.', 'Looking ahead to 2017, we forecast that global shipments will increase by approximately 2.5% to 66 million tons to 68 million tons. China and India are expected to register modest gains next year, and continued growth is projected for most other regions, especially the Americas.', 'Finally, we do expect a typical seasonal slowdown late fourth quarter and early first quarter. And two key factors we are continuing to watch closely are Chinese exports and the pace of new capacity ramp up.', ""Now, I'll turn the call over to Rich Mack.""]",management_discussion,MOS_184892
2126,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thank you, Mike, and good morning to you all. As Mike's assessment indicates, we expect the recent potash price and phosphate margin to remain fairly stable, seasonality aside. We also expect demand to remain strong, and limited additional price appreciation in the near term."", ""Mosaic's performance for the quarter reflects the incrementally improved market environment, but it also reflects the resilience we've built into our business. We are maintaining our focus on the long term and controlling the things we can control, most notably our execution, our operational costs, and our capital."", 'For the quarter, we reported earnings per diluted share of $0.11, which included a negative $0.30 impact from notable items that brought adjusted earnings per share to $0.41. Earnings also included a benefit of $0.08 per share from adjusting the full-year effective tax rate accrual.', 'Our cost-reduction efforts are evident in the bottom line across our segments. You can see that we are achieving meaningful cost savings, and keep in mind that we made two acquisitions over this period. Our SG&A today is lower than it was before those acquisitions; and in fact, third quarter SG&A is the lowest in the last nine years. We continue to be on track to meet our combined expense-reduction goals of $575 million by 2018.', 'We are demonstrating similar discipline with respect to our capital. We are continuing key strategic projects, and we are investing to ensure the safety of our employees as well as the mechanical integrity of our assets.', 'As part of our strategic planning process, we took a very critical look at our CapEx requirements over the next five years. We are considering every capital decision very carefully; and as a result, we expect CapEx to come down meaningfully after 2017 to a level of approximately $800 million per year, down from earlier expectations of approximately $1.2 billion.', 'With meaningful changes to our five-year capital program and significantly reduced operating costs, as well as expectations of an improving environment, we have maintained our dividend, which we will continue to review as market conditions evolve.', 'We have also changed our target leverage range, now at 2.0 times to 2.5 times net-debt to adjusted EBITDA. We are also in the process of upsizing our revolving line of credit from $1.5 billion to $2 billion, maintaining our targeted liquidity at $2.5 billion. Going forward, we will continue to assess our cash generation and cash uses in light of our firm commitment to maintaining an investment-grade credit rating.', ""Now, I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the third quarter came in slightly above the top-end of our guidance range at 2.2 million tons. The volumes reflect the pent-up demand that came to fruition during the quarter, which in turn drew down producer and channel inventories. Prices responded accordingly, though they remain low compared with a year ago in earlier periods."", ""In the fourth quarter, we continue to expect positive pricing trends, and our guidance is $160 per ton to $175 per ton. With our volume expectations in the fourth quarter of 1.9 million tons to 2.1 million tons, we believe the second half reflects the strong bunching of demand we talked about earlier this year. The narrower than normal ranges reflect Mosaic's essentially sold-out position for the fourth quarter."", 'Our Potash gross margin rate for the quarter was 9%, above our guidance despite an operating rate in the low 60% range, and prices at the low end of our guidance range. The improvement reflects the benefits of our ongoing and aggressive work to reduce costs and optimize our operations.', 'We expect fourth quarter margins to improve further with tailwinds from higher prices, higher operating rates to meet demand, and continued cost-reduction efforts. We also will be expensing some turnaround work during the quarter, and expect our gross margin rate to be in the mid-teens. Our margin rate guidance also incorporates further weakness in K-Mag prices reflective of the softer SOP market dynamics.', 'Moving on to Phosphates, our business performed as expected. The Phosphate gross margin rate continued to expand as raw material cost reductions benefited our cost of goods sold, and with rock costs returning to more normal levels. Blended costs of rock reclined to $60 per ton during the quarter.', 'Going forward, we expect slightly more variability in quarterly rock costs than in years past. However, our teams have done an outstanding job of mitigating some of the issues we encountered in the second quarter, and our goal is to maintain rock costs at or near current levels.', ""Our average Phosphate's realized price and shipment volumes were in the middle of our guidance range, with strong global demand persisting, and with prices stabilizing despite falling raw material costs. As Mike said, the fourth quarter is seasonally slower, but we expect volumes to remain fairly robust at 2.1 million tons to 2.4 million tons, and DAP prices to seasonally weaken to a range of $300 per ton to $330 per ton."", 'We expect relatively stable margins with a gross margin rate in the upper single digits, as lower input costs largely offset expected weakness in realized prices. We plan to run our Phosphates facilities at approximately 85% of capacity.', ""Before I leave Phosphates, I'd like to briefly discuss our ammonia contract with CF Industries. As you know, the contract, which begins in 2017, allowed us to forgo the construction of a $1.2 billion ammonia manufacturing plant. We've worked with CF to align on the logistics, and we expect our barge to be completed in mid-2017."", ""Given the long-term nature of the contract, the impact to our P&L will fluctuate based on nitrogen production economics. We fully expect there will be times we'll be benefiting from it and times that we will not."", 'Moving on now to International Distribution, which was a bright spot during the quarter. Excellent farm economics in Brazil drove strong demand and improving prices. In addition, our unique position allowed us to capitalize on improving pricing trends with a meaningful improvement in International Distribution segment operating earnings.', 'Gross margin per ton came in well ahead of expectations as a result of higher volumes and higher per ton margins of MicroEssentials, as well as better fixed cost absorption. As a reference point, sales of MicroEssentials in Brazil are up over 70% year-to-date.', ""With a more stable operating environment in Brazil, we expect gross margins to be around $20 per ton, and volumes to be in the range of 1.7 million tons to 1.9 million tons during the fourth quarter. As in Potash, the narrower than normal volume range reflects Mosaic's sold-out position for the fourth quarter."", 'Finally, the effective tax rate in the quarter was negative. The provision for income taxes in the third quarter included a $28 million benefit related to the expected reduction of the full-year effective tax rate. The low effective tax rate is a function of tax deductions that remain fairly constant, primarily depletion, combined with a currently low taxable income. In the near-term and in 2017, we expect more variability in our effective tax rate. Our other full-year guidance numbers can be seen on the slide.', 'To summarize, we are seeing incremental improvements in the business climate, but we are continuing to plan for whatever the markets may bring. Mosaic has the financial strength and management discipline to adapt and take advantage of opportunities as conditions change.', ""With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc for his closing thoughts and to moderate our Q&A session. Joc?""]",management_discussion,MOS_184892
2127,James C. O'Rourke,"['Thanks, Rich. Before we move on, I would like to address the situation at our New Wales Phosphate facility in Florida. As you probably know, a sinkhole developed in one cell of a gyp stack on the site, resulting in the loss of processed water that was atop that portion of the stack. This is an unfortunate situation, but I would like to commend the excellent around the clock work our teams in Florida are performing to resolve it.', ""The key points for investors to understand are first and foremost, we have performed over 1,000 well tests, and we have not identified any off-site (16:24) impacts from the water loss. Collection walls are retaining the water, and we are pumping that water back up to another area of the gyp stack. We have done and we'll continue to do extensive water testing around the site, and we do not expect that there will be any off-site impact."", 'Second, phosphate production at New Wales has not been impacted, and we do not anticipate any impacts. And third, based on the work we completed so far, and the consent order reached with the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, we are comfortable that the cost to repair the sinkhole will be manageable.', 'Now to summarize our thoughts on the quarter and the business environment, agricultural commodity fundamentals, including fertilizer fundamentals, are improving; albeit slowly. And Mosaic is benefiting from those improvements.', 'Just as important, our work to reduce costs is driving better results now. And we are going to maintain this focus as conditions improve so that we can outperform across the cycle. And we are maintaining our solid financial foundation, by managing our liquidity and capital spending carefully.', 'Mosaic is performing well, and we remain in an excellent position to thrive as conditions continue to improve.', 'Now, we would be happy to take your questions.']",management_discussion,MOS_184892

2129,Andrew Wong,"[""Hi, thanks, and good morning. So, my first question would be on the leverage ratio, how does your current leverage ratio compare to your new target range? And then second, in your prepared remarks, you've been pretty strong defending the balance sheet, but with the lower cash balance and some CapEx spend still remaining, how does that tie together with the overall dividend strategy? Thanks.""]",question_answer,MOS_184892
2130,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Andrew. So, I'm going to hand most of this over to Rich, but let me just re-emphasize. We do take a conservative view with respect to our balance sheet. But also, we don't take a one-quarter view with respect to any of this. And I want to highlight that while the operating cash flow was relatively low this quarter at $96 million, if you take it over two quarters, we were $679 million over two quarters, which is down only 14% from last year. So, while we do have capital still required, we're generating good cash flows, and of course, we will continue to assess how those two fit together."", 'Rich, do you want to talk a little more about our CapEx?']",question_answer,MOS_184892
2131,Richard L. Mack,"[""Sure. Thanks, Joc, and good morning, Andrew. First on the leverage ratio, the way that we currently look at it is we're adapting our balance sheet philosophy, our capital management philosophy to the current market environment. And if you go back and you look at history, this is really a vestige of the years after the cargo split off transaction. We first rolled out our capital management philosophy in 2013, and it hasn't meaningfully changed since that point in time."", ""Where we're at right now, we're not changing our overall liquidity buffer. We're keeping that at $2.5 billion. We're simply changing the mix of that by upsizing our revolver from $1.5 billion to $2 billion. And as you noted, we're moving our target leverage ratio from 2 times to 2.5 times, and I think it's important to note that we take a look at that on a through-cycle basis."", ""We're a cyclical industry, and there are going to be times where we're going to be over it, and there are times when we're going to be under it. And, I think it's all guided by the guide post of a strong investment-grade credit rating, and we believe that the ratios and the liquidity buffer that we have articulated will meet just that."", ""And then, moving on to your second question on the dividend. Obviously, a topical issue in the environment that we're in right now, obviously, it's something that we continue to monitor very closely. As you've seen in our results, we've aggressively and proactivity reduced our spend, both in capital and in operating costs."", ""Earlier this year, we indicated that the second half was going to be better than the first half, and we're starting to see that, particularly in the Potash business and also with the good results in our ID business this quarter. And with the $2.5 billion, we certainly have ample liquidity and we can use this for a short period of time, but it's not something that you would use for a long period to cover your dividends."", ""So, what I would simply say, in summary, is that this is something that we're going to continue to watch. It will be dependent on where the market goes, and it's going to be dependent on the tradeoffs between capital, operating expenses, and cash available for dividends.""]",question_answer,MOS_184892

2133,Operator,"['Your next question comes from Jonas Oxgaard from Bernstein. Please go ahead.', ""James C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Jonas. I'm going to start here and I'll hand it over to Rich. But a great lead in for I think what is a great story, which is our MicroEssentials story.\nFirst of all, yes, we did increase capacity. If you'll remember, we spent $250 million to increase the capacity of MicroEssentials at our New Wales plant. That largely got completed at the end of the second quarter. So, it's only been a very short period of time we've had new capacity available. In North America, our shipments of MicroEssentials will be up, although the growth rate of MicroEssentials in North America are still fairly low or now slowing down.\nHowever, in Brazil, where we have what we believe to be a great market opportunity with our own distribution business and the acquisition of the ADM business, this year alone we've seen a 60% increase in MicroEssentials sales, and that's all due to higher availability. So, you know, with where we're sitting, I think this is a great story and one that will continue with the new capacity.\nAnd sorry, I think I might have said Rich's name, but I will hand it to Rick to give us a little more detail. Rick McLellan.\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, good morning. I'll just add to what Joc said, the production that came on at New Wales allowed us to point extra tons towards Brazil in the third quarter. And so, our growth in MicroEssentials is really coming out of this new production, and is occurring in Q3 into Brazil, and Q4 in North America.\nAnd just a reflection of how we're changing, our MicroEssentials sales for the third quarter were a record ever for Mosaic. And up until now, we've been supply constrained. Now, we can go and look at those markets where we've been developing the market for this product.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nAnd just highlight as well, just before we leave that, I don't want to miss saying that the big benefit in Latin America is, we not only get the producer margin for the MicroEssentials, but we also take that distributor margin. So, it's a great market for that product.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nVincent S. Andrews - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC\nThanks. And good morning, everyone. Question on your CapEx forecast going from $1.2 billion to $800 million. Could you just give us a sense of what's allowed it to come down so much? And is there any impact to your plans for K3?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSure. Thanks, Vincent. Let me say, first of all, we prioritize our capital as we've always prioritized our capital, which is making sure we protect the integrity, both mechanically and structurally, of our plants; that our key strategic projects continue on pace. But beyond that, we assume that all of our capital is negotiable. And so, what have we done? We have reduced or eliminated any capital that we believe isn't in that critical group for now. Some of it has been deferred. Some of it has been eliminated.\nAnd in terms of K3, we absolutely are focused on maintaining the critical path of the K3 project, and we will be getting to the bottom of that in February, or a little later than February, and continuing that project on schedule. Next year, our focus is to have a capital allocation of between $800 million and $900 million, and then decreasing to $800 million after that. So, thank you.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nAnd, Vincent, this is Rich. Just one supplemental comment to Joc's review there. And that is, keep in mind, we have spent ample capital in prior years, and so the condition of our assets and the quality that we find our businesses in right now, are in great shape. And so, that does allow us some additional flexibility to time some of the spending in the years ahead of us.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay. Good add.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nHi, good morning, thanks very much. I was listening to Rich's comments about the ammonia barges earlier on. I just wanted to clarify it somewhat. Does this mean you'll be taking ammonia from CF in mid-year 2017, rather than at the beginning of 2017?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSimple answer is yes. I'll leave it to Rich to give any color to that.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nYes. Your assumption is correct, Jeff. I don't think there is any more color to it.\nJeffrey J. Zekauskas - JPMorgan Securities LLC\nOkay. And...\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nJust to add one thing, Jeff. We've made an agreement with CF to handle the delay, so we're taking tons from them, but in a different manner than through the barge.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Please go ahead.\nMark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC\nThank you. Just to circle back to the CapEx question. Is it fair to assume that the $600 million target still has a decent amount of growth CapEx in it? And where would that growth CapEx tend to be focused post Esterhazy?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSorry. Hi. Thanks, Mark. First, let me clarify. I heard you say $600 million, we're $800 million to $900 million.\nMark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC\nI'm sorry, $800 million.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, next year. And so, where is that focused? Let me just break it down. Our sustaining capital, which we were targeting in the $600 million range, we're now targeting in the, let's say, $450 million or $400 million to $500 million range, and the other $300 million to $400 million will be spent on growth capital.\nThe first priority one is clearly Esterhazy K3. We have a few small projects that are coming to completion like the New Wales MicroEssentials plant, the barges and others. And then, we'll be focusing I guess early in the next decade probably on the new mines in Florida. But other than that, most of them are complete.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nStephen Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch\nYes, how much of that $650 million of cash that you have is offshore, and therefore would be subject to tax if repatriated?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nSteve, I'm going to hand that straight to Rich to give you the details for the cash positions.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Steve, I don't have an exact number for you, but there is a portion of it that would be offshore and be subject to the minimal withholding taxes.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from Ben Isaacson from Scotiabank. Please go ahead.\nOliver Rowe - Scotia Capital, Inc. (Broker)\nThis is Oliver Rowe on for Ben. Could you please provide some color on the dynamic that you're seeing in the global rock market? We're beginning to see some pricing slippage in international markets that have been stable historically. And then, how does this play into your stripping margins, which we've seen falling for the last few years?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay, Oliver, I'm going to hand that straight to Mike. Mike keeps pretty close tabs on the global S&Ds for all of the, both potash but mostly and obviously the phosphate products. So, I think the phosphate rock market is something Mike keeps pretty close tabs on.\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nSure. Good morning, Oliver. Yeah, you're correct that we've seen some slippage in phosphate rock prices. As you probably know, rock is transacted a little bit differently than the finished products, and that if you're running a plant that's not integrated and relies on rock you typically contract for a period of time. So, as fundamentals change, there is a lag in terms of when rock prices adjust.\nThat said, we haven't seen a Draconian drop in rock prices. I think in terms of the structure of that market, rock prices have held up reasonably well in the current environment. With respect to how that plays into the stripping margin, our stripping margin is calculated based on a finished phosphate price DAP, less the cost of ammonia and sulfur. So, it doesn't come into play in terms of the stripping margin that you might see coming from us. And I think as we've indicated earlier, our actual rock costs have varied a little bit over time, but remain fairly constant in terms of trend costs.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Adam Samuelson from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nAdam Samuelson - Goldman Sachs & Co.\nYes, thanks. Good morning, everyone. Maybe a question in potash in North America. Your volumes in the quarter were up pretty strongly, you've laid out an interesting outlook for producer inventories through early next year to be down maybe about a million tons year-over-year and 1Q 2017. Can you talk about your view on distributor inventory levels into early next year? And specifically, thinking about your shipment outlook for North America to be flat year-over-year, if you're actually seeing underlying consumption growth with the American farmer? Thanks.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThanks, Adam. I'm going to leave this over to Rick, but let me start by saying, yes, in fact, we believe the distributor – or sorry, producer inventories are well down and going to continue to go down, due to curtailments, including our own Colonsay curtailment and good demand in North America.\nIn terms of the distributor and channel inventories, the market has been such that nobody wants to have extra inventory in their system. So, I think that bodes well for people buying hand to mouth, which means there isn't a great build-up in that channel. But, I'll let Rick give that some color.\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Joc. Good morning. Frankly, there's a couple of things happening. I think Joc's – between Joc and Mike's information, we've seen and we'll continue to see producer inventories draw down.\nIn North America, we're shipping only to people that are buying right now. So, we aren't able to, because of our own inventory position, kind of fill the pipeline, like maybe in other years that we would have. And early indications coming from the farm is that at this type of price level, application rates are as good or better than we've seen in the last two years. Mike?\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, I would just add maybe a little bit of a global perspective. We've seen global shipments come down the last two years by about 1.8 million tons per year, and that goes back to the big build of channel inventories worldwide in 2014. If you recall, from the charts that we've shown earlier, shipments in 2014 ballooned about 9.2 million tons. And it has taken a couple of years to work that down.\nAnd I think what's exciting, I think there's a very good and under-appreciated story in potash shaping up for 2017. We are finally going to see I think growth in global potash shipments next year to the tune of 2.5 million tons or so, due to the fact that we can't live off the pipeline anymore.\nAnd secondly, we've seen some very significant adjustments on the supply side, with North America alone about 2.25 million tons of capacity, get permanently closed. So, you add that all together, and I think the projected producer inventories that we're showing for North America are probably similar for most producers around the globe. So, bottom line is, I think there have been some very positive developments take place in the global potash market.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Joel Jackson from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.\nJoel Jackson - BMO Capital Markets (Canada)\nHi, good morning. I had two questions. So, first on Colonsay, I know you talked about making a decision whether you will keep Colonsay offline in 2017 or make it later. But can you give us a bit of insight into where you are right now and the puts and takes on that decision?\nAnd my second question would be, you guided to earlier this year that the issue at New Wales, the sinkhole, would cost maybe $20 million to $50 million over the next couple of years. I think you've spent $60 million in Q3. I don't know if there's some insurance or some accruals going on, but can you give a little color on that? Thank you.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThanks, Joel. Well, let me touch on Colonsay first. So Colonsay, we shut down to ensure that we maintained our inventory position over this period of time to what I would say is low but manageable levels.\nAs we go into 2017, we're frankly expecting a pretty good spring for all of the reasons that Mike Rahm has just explained. So, we're believing that it will probably be necessary for us to be starting up Colonsay in the early new year, as per the original expectations that we set.\nIn terms of New Wales – and I'll let Rich – Rick talk a little bit more about Colonsay in a second, and the potash market in North America; but in terms of New Wales, yes, we certainly guided to, I think, $30 million to $50 million. And the difference between the upper end, the $50 million, and the $60 million was more testing and water treatment for a longer period of time than was originally anticipated. And just to be clear, I think this is a reserve. This is not an outflow at this stage. This is a reserve that will cover the cost over the next 14 months to 20 months. So, it's not a cost today.\nAs per the original expectations, we expect that repairing the hole will take around the $30 million. Other treatment and whatnot around the plant will take the second $30 million. And Rick, do you want to talk about the potash market?\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Joc. Good morning, Joel. Just to add to Joc's comments about needing to bring back Colonsay early in the new year, as we look at global inventories in country, we're sitting in Brazil right now with their in-peak season, but there's a lot less inventory sitting in distributor hands there.\nWe're seeing drawdowns in India, and the market is beginning to move a lot faster in China. So, we see those inventories in the distributor hands globally being drawn down; and for that purpose, we're going to need to make sure that we've got the inventory to make that happen.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThe other thing I just want to not let that comment about seasonality get missed.

We will run to value, not volume; but when there is a market need, we will have the volume available for our customers. Thanks.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Chris Parkinson from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nChristopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\nPerfect. Thank you. You've seen the Chinese take off a few million tons of phosphate capacity this year, which has clearly helped offset some increases elsewhere, but you've also seen the remaining export FOB prices continue to decline, which has been reflected in lower central Asian prices. So, can you just comment on your expectations for the phosphate global cost curve over the next few years, given the high price Chinese capacity is now being offset by lower capacity in the Middle East and North Africa? And how should investors really kind of parse out these themes through 2018, 2019? Thanks.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Chris. I think this is easiest to just let straight over to Mike. I might add a bit at the end, but I think Mike Rahm can give us some thought on the...\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Chris. It's a good question, and something that we're watching very carefully. As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29% to 2.4 million tons. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here, that we'd see about a 3 million ton drop.\nI think, just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphates, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near-term. And I think one of those is how quickly we see restructuring take place in China. When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit, and they've flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India.\nAnd fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place.\nAnd with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry. They are high-cost players that we think will get driven out. And as we've indicated, the Chinese make no bones about the fact that they too believe that restructuring is needed.\nAnd I guess the bottom line is when we look ahead, we see decent demand growth of 2%, 2.5% per year. And if you look at shipments of 65 million tons, 2% growth is 1.3 million tons per year. Over five years, it's 6.5 million tons, which is roughly equal to the additional capacity coming on in Morocco and Saudi Arabia. So, we think that that will happen.\nAnd in China, we would expect that there will be restructuring; and at the end of this decade, China will be operating a smaller, more efficient, and a bit more competitive industry. So, I guess a long-winded answer that we do see a very constructive long-term outlook for phosphate; and in the near term, a few adjustments that I think the market will go through to set itself up for a very good medium-term outlook.\nChristopher S. Parkinson - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)\nThank you.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Don Carson from Susquehanna Financial. Please go ahead.\nDon Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nYes. Question for Rich. If you were to do a major acquisition, would you still want to retain your investment-grade rating, or would you be willing to go below that for a while? Or, said another way, if you did a major acquisition, would you have to issue equity to maintain that investment-grade rating?\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nGood morning, Don. We started out as a non-investment grade company in 2004 when we were formed. This industry just is not very conducive to be in that mode for any meaningful period of time. And that's one of the reasons why being investment grade is as important as it is to us. So, I think that's a pillar here, and I think you would expect that we would not – at least, as currently envisioned, want to slip below non-investment grade, even in the context of an acquisition.\nDon Carson - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP\nAnd any update on where you are in discussions with Vale?\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nWell, that's something you see these in the news. We read the same things that you do in terms of these market rumors; but, as you know, we can't comment on anything that we do relative to M&A, and that has been our long-standing policy, and it remains the case today.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nLet me highlight; however, though, that if we were to look at any acquisition, it is very situational. How we would use equity, how we would use debt, it's going to depend on how that affects our credit metrics, how affordable it is, how much cash flow the acquisition might bring, and the long-term returns to Mosaic. We always said that anything we do is going to be focused on adding long-term value to this company and their shareholders.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Yonah Weisz from HSBC. Please go ahead.\nYonah Weisz - HSBC Bank Plc (Tel Aviv Branch)\nYes, hi, good afternoon. A question or two if I may. First of all, given the operational issues that you've had with the sinkhole and I think with the U.S. Department of Labor issue, would you not think that a bit more sustaining capital could be needed in 2017 to shore up these type of safety issues?\nAnd in addition, could you talk a bit about how you see taxes developing in 2017? What kind of tax rate you think you may be paying?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay. I got to understand if I got the questions right. So first of all, the sinkhole is part of our capital and expenditures that we will spend in 2017. We go through a very detailed and comprehensive process to determine our capital needs; and in doing so, decide what we can do, balancing off our need for cash, the benefits of long-term sustaining capital, et cetera. So, all of those things come into play. The sinkhole, in terms of capital, will probably be about half of that $60 million will be capital, and so it's virtually not an issue from a capital perspective.\nI don't know what you're referring to in terms of Department of Labor, so I'm going to leave that. But recognize that the sinkhole itself, a natural event. These things do happen. It's very unfortunate. And our goal is to make it right. We take it very seriously, and we will make it as per before. We will treat the water, and we will spend the money that it requires to do a great job of that. That's our social commitment.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nAnd, Yonah, this is Rich. If you were referring to the RCRA settlement or matter that we had previously, that would be included in our forecasted capital. So, we wouldn't see any incremental capital beyond what you've heard earlier today.\nYou asked a question about taxes in 2017. I think that taxes at least in the short-term with the lower level of profitability, because of just simply the lower pricing environment you have for phosphate and potash, you should expect that in 2017, a good proxy for our effective tax rate would be around 10%. And then as the cycle continues to turn, in 2018 and later, a normalized level for us would be approximately 20%.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of John Roberts from UBS. Please go ahead.\nJohn Roberts - UBS Securities LLC\nThank you. How much of the margin improvement in International Distribution is timing effects? I assume what you're buying is going down faster than what you're selling.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nI'm going to hand this over to Rich – or Rick, sorry. Now, clearly, as you sell down inventories at higher prices in a distribution business, you'll make some gains; but the underlying performance of the business is actually improving, and that's driving our earnings. Rick?\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, I think when we look at the margin tower that we get in our International Distribution businesses, it's driven by how we go about selling it. It's the logistics, and it's how we choose to operate our plants and our blending plants in each of the countries.\nSo with better utilization and making use of how we move product into the country and how we move it out to the customer, we're able to increase margins. The biggest portion driving the margin increase is us being able to deliver a premium product like MicroEssentials in those marketplaces.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Vincent Anderson from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nVincent Anderson - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.\nGood morning, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to touch a high level on your marketing strategy for Ma'aden as that ramps. Are you thinking about maximizing netback on every ton, or targeting larger tenders, or given what we're seeing in the market over the next couple of years, walking that capacity out gently?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nI'm going to hand that, again, back to Rick. But let me say, Ma'aden will come in and it offers two advantages to Mosaic that I want to emphasize. One is geographic diversity and the ability to reach our Asian markets at a beneficial freight cost. And the other is just its low, low position on the cost curve, which is a low, sustainable, bottom of the cost-curve position.\nSo, we see that as an important addition to our portfolio of products. How we bring that to market will depend largely on how the market is developing at the time. And as Mike said earlier, we fully expect that this product will be needed as the Chinese industry is restructured. So, let me hand it over to Rick to talk a little more detail of the marketing strategy.\nRichard N. McLellan - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Joc, I think you've really cut to the big items. We've got existing sales books on and will have them. And from a Mosaic perspective, we're going to fit those tons into our existing sales book. And the beauty about having the tons coming out of Ma'aden, is frankly, will be the first multi-hemispheric phosphate producer. And we'll be able to move product to markets, which gives us significant advantage when we go to looking at where we might ship product out of against our sales book. The details of the Ma'aden marketing plant are still being developed, though.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nNow, I'm going to hand it over to Rich Mack to make a couple of comments as well. He sits on the board of the joint venture and is intimately involved in the details.\nRichard L. Mack - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. And I was just going to speak to timing. We've noted that the ammonia production has begun in Saudi Arabia, and that will continue to ramp up. But I think with respect to phosphate production, as we noted in the past, I think a good date is going to be the middle part of 2017. And this is not like when you are commissioning a brand new plant, you don't just turn on the spigot and have 3 million tons the next day. And so, it will be a ramp-up process, that will take likely several months before we would be anywhere near a full capacity rate.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Michael Piken from Cleveland Research. Please go ahead.\nMichael Leith Piken - Cleveland Research Co. LLC\nYeah, good morning. I just wanted to see and dig in a little bit more onto India and your outlook for 2017. Do you see the change in the subsidy levels having a big impact next year? Or do you think it's more just a function that India has worked down their inventories that's driving the growth that you're forecasting for that market? Thank you.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nThank you, Michael. I'm going to hand that straight to Mike Rahm again to talk about the India market.\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, Michael, I think there are several factors that underpin our optimistic outlook for India next year. One, I'm going to start with the rupee, that has remained relatively stable compared to the volatility of other currencies.\nSecondly, international P&K prices have come down; and as a consequence, that has – with current subsidy schemes, has translated into lower retail prices. That is underpinning good on-farm demand, which has resulted in – or is resulting in a pull-down of channel inventories, especially at kind of that retail level.\nAs we go forward, I think there's a great opportunity for India to try to address the imbalance between nitrogen, phosphate, and potash use. And I think what they've done so far with the subsidy is conducive to trying to achieve a better balance. So, I wouldn't see any major change in that. I think given where international prices are headed, given a stable outlook for the rupee, there will be a subsidy in place that continues to encourage P&K consumption in India.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of Jacob Bout from CIBC. Please go ahead.\nJacob Bout - CIBC World Markets, Inc.\nGood morning, and thanks for taking my call. Joc, maybe you can comment about how you're thinking about the recent wave of consolidation in the ag, chem and fert sector. Do you think you need to be bigger to be competitive? And maybe, specifically, thinking about the potential Agrium/Potash merger, how does that change your operating environment?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah, thanks, Jacob. Look, in terms of consolidation, we have long said that there would likely be consolidation towards the bottom of the cycle. Having said that, bigger is not necessarily always better. I'm not referring directly to any of those. I think they have their own benefits and their own reasons for doing it.\nBut for us, particularly, I don't think we need to be bigger to be competitive. I'm very comfortable in our competitive position. I'm very comfortable in our position and how we will compete with those bigger companies. And particularly the NewCo, or combined Agrium/Potash company. I feel comfortable we can compete with that.\nHow does that affect our strategy? Look, I think our strategy has long been to serve our customers well, make sure we run for value, not volume, to make sure that we run for a long-term customer relationship that gives great service and product to our customers. I believe as long as we do that, we will do very well in any market.\nOkay, we have time for a couple more questions here, and then we'll have to go.\nOperator\nYour next question comes from the line of P.J. Juvekar from Citi. Please go ahead.\nP.J. Juvekar - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)\nYes, good morning. Joc, you mentioned bigger is not better. Your competitors are merging, and you are going to be smaller in relation to their size, but you also don't have the kind of cost-cutting opportunity that they will have. So, would you be willing to align with another, let's say, smaller distributor?\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nI think that's getting into a little too much detail to ask if we would align with a different distributor. We have a number of customers, all of whom are important to us. Including CPS, Agrium's retail arm, is an important customer. I don't believe the alignment of retailers with suppliers is necessary, or in this case.\nBut, I want to go to your other comment about not having the cost-cutting potential. I think Mosaic has cut $575 million over time, or is committed to and close to completing a $575 million cost-cutting program, which I believe is industry-leading. We have seen fantastic changes in our cost structure. We've done great things with respect to our capital management. So, again, on a per-ton basis, we absolutely believe we have the same potential to cut our cost, and we believe we are as focused or more focused on cost than anybody else in this industry.\nOperator\nAnd your final question comes from the line of Brett Wong from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.\nBrett W. S. Wong - Piper Jaffray & Co.\nThanks for fitting me in here at the end, guys. I appreciate it. Mike, just wanted to ask if you could talk about some other currencies in your outlook into 2017 impacting potash pricing, specifically Russia or China?\nDr. Michael R. Rahm - The Mosaic Co.\nYeah. Thanks, Brett. That's a good question. To some extent, we think the key potash currencies kind of follow oil. And I guess if you've got a view on oil, I think you have a view on some of the key currencies.\nIf you look at what the Russian and Belarusian ruble have done since the first quarter of 2014, they collapsed about 55% through the first quarter of this year. With some improvement in oil prices, we've seen the Russian ruble appreciate a bit. And I think, looking ahead, I guess, we're not oil experts, but I think if you're trying to assess where that's going, having a view on oil is probably your best guide.\nJames C. O'Rourke - The Mosaic Co.\nOkay. Thank you. So to conclude our call, I just want to reiterate a couple of our key messages. First, business conditions are improving, and have improved throughout the quarter as expected, and our outlook remains positive. Second, the actions we've taken to reduce our costs, to optimize our assets and lower our capital spending are clearly benefiting our bottom line. And third, our International Distribution business is exceeding expectations, primarily because of strong economics and our investments to grow in Brazil.\nMosaic remains well situated to succeed through this low point in the business cycle, and to thrive as conditions continue to improve.

As you saw from the statistics, if you look at year-to-date exports out of China, they're down 29% to 2.4 million tons. We think that is clearly on track for our projection for quite a while here, that we'd see about a 3 million ton drop."", ""I think, just to kind of look at the big picture of phosphates, we see a very constructive longer-term outlook, but there are some uncertainties in the near-term.

When you look at global phosphate shipments, they really have flattened a bit, and they've flattened due largely to declines that have taken place in China and India."", ""And fortunately, all of those declines have been offset by gains in other parts of the world. But the fact that we've seen declines in China and India has really hit the Chinese industry very hard. And as a consequence, we've seen Asian prices in particular get hit. And as a result, I think that will accelerate the restructuring taking place."", ""And with respect to the industry cost curve, as you know, the Chinese industry is a very heterogeneous industry. They are high-cost players that we think will get driven out.

2214,Mike Rahm,"['Thanks, Joc. Let me start by acknowledging the obvious. Industry phosphate and potash margins have declined significantly as evident in our earnings so far this year, as well as our third quarter guidance. The drivers of the downturn range from a collapse of key phosphate and potash currencies to the deferral of demand this year to elevated channel inventories to the startup or even the expectation of the startup of new capacity.', 'Buyer sentiment remains cautious for several reasons, such as volatile crop prices and exchange rate uncertainties. But we do think the global supply and demand balance is not as far out of kilter as current prices indicate. More importantly, low prices are causing material adjustments on both the supply and demand side of the ledger. High cost production is moving offline and demand is accelerating, especially in key growth markets.', 'On the demand side, prospects remain solid. In fact, we have not changed our P&K shipment guidance for 2016. We still project that global phosphate shipments will total 65 million tons to 66 million tons this year and global MLP shipments will total 59 million tons to 60 million tons, despite the long delays in settling contracts with Chinese and Indian buyers.', 'Furthermore, we see a high likelihood of seasonal bunching of demand for both P&K in the second half of the year. Our first look at 2017 indicates that phosphate shipments are forecast to climb to 66 million tons to 68 million tons and global MLP shipments are projected to increase to 61 million tons to 63 million tons next year.', 'Several economic and agronomic factors underpins constructive outlook. First, plant nutrients remain affordable despite lower and volatile crop prices. In fact, our affordability metric at the end of July indicated that plant nutrients were 21% more affordable than the average since 2010. It is worth noting that our affordability metric is calculated using only corn, soybean and wheat prices, and crop prices are not moving in lockstep. Corn, soybean and wheat prices have fallen, while other prices, including sugar, cotton and coffee have increased significantly this year.', 'Second, shipment prospects are bolstered by the pull-down of channel inventory so far this year, especially throughout the Americas. Our sales team tells us that channel inventories are thin, heading into what is expected to be another very good fall application season in North America. In Brazil, the most recent statistics show that phosphate and potash inventories throughout the distribution channel shrunk nearly 600,000 tons and almost 200,000 tons, respectively, during the first half of this year.', 'Third, Brazilian demand forecast just keep getting revised higher and higher, despite the chaotic political backdrop, a volatile exchange rate and tight farm credit. That is not a surprise given record-high local currency prices for soybeans, corn, sugar, cotton and coffee. Based on record first half shipments, our team now projects that total fertilizer shipments will top 32 million tons this year, up 10% from forecast just six months ago. Shipments this year could best the previous high mark of 32.2 million tons in 2014.', 'Fourth, demand in India looks to be back on a solid growth trajectory. The monsoon is delivering above average rainfall across nearly all of the country for the first time in three years. In addition, the combination of lower international prices, modest cuts in subsidies and a relatively stable rupee has resulted in declines in retail DAP and MAP prices of roughly 15% and 30%, respectively, and sets the stage for strong P&K use. Demand prospects in other Latin American and Asian countries, such as Argentina and Pakistan, remain positive. Furthermore, significant demand is emerging from other regions, such as the former Soviet Union and Africa that are not necessarily on most radar screens.', ""On the supply side of the ledger, several adjustments have occurred and more are underway today. In the case of phosphate, China has shuttered capacity as evidenced by the 1.5 million ton decline in DAP, MAP and TSP exports during the first half of this year. Restructuring of China's large phosphate sector is beginning to take place and plans outlined at the national phosphate and compound fertilizer industry association's annual conference in May called for the permanent closure of outdated facilities with capacity of 3 million tons of P2O5 or the equivalent of 6.5 million tons of DAP by the end of this decade."", 'In the case of potash, large producers continue to optimize operations by idling or shutting down higher cost facilities and maximizing operating rates at lower cost facilities in order to compete with producers who have benefited from a collapse of their currencies. For example, all of the North American facilities that were at the right end of every estimate of the industry cost curve have closed. The closure of six North American mines has resulted in a net loss of 2.25 million tons of capacity.', 'Finally, foreign exchange tailwinds are beginning to diminish for some producers. Currencies like the ruble are recovering along with the price of oil. Inflation, as expected, is picking up in these countries, and most importantly, P&K prices have come down significantly. In our view, the large drop in potash prices is more the result of the collapse that keep potash currencies rather than a surge of new capacity. This is an important part of our thesis that fundamentals are in better balance than current P&K prices would indicate.', ""In summary, adjustments are taking place in response to low prices and margins. Demand is beginning to accelerate and high cost capacity is shutting down. As a result, we project relatively stable global phosphate and potash operating rates through the rest of this decade. While we're not wildly bullish, we see some positive developments that markets seem to be ignoring or discounting for now."", 'Joc?']",management_discussion,MOS_104619
2215,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Thanks for that insight, Mike. Clearly, the current environment is very challenging even with the strong global demand Mike described. While this weak part of the cycle has been more pronounced than we anticipated, we do understand commodity businesses are cyclical and that the troughs can be difficult. We also understand the imperative to navigate the troughs while enhancing our ability to outperform in better times. We are taking the necessary actions to do just that. We're conserving cash and protecting our balance sheet so that we can continue to meet our customers' needs and seek opportunities to drive future shareholder value."", ""We've taken a number of steps to reduce costs. First, we're well on our way to achieving the five-year $500 million expense reduction goal we established almost three years ago. The cuts have been implemented across the business."", 'Second, on our last earnings call, we told you that we are targeting an additional $75 million in savings in our support functions. With the actions we took in June, we are well on our way to achieving that goal.', ""Third, we are continuing to optimize our assets, so that we can produce enough crop nutrients to meet our customers' demands while reducing our cost per ton. With the decision to idle our Colonsay Potash Mine for the remainder of 2016, we will be able to meet market demand with our lower-cost Belle Plaine and Esterhazy mines, as well as our existing potash inventory."", ""And fourth, we're managing our capital carefully without starving our operations or risking employee safety. We are deferring or permanently eliminating capital spending when and where we can."", 'All these decisions have reduced our costs. Our MOP cash production cost per ton came in this quarter at $98 per ton, which included $21 per ton of brine management costs. For the first half of 2016, our MOP cash costs came in at $93 per ton, which is $74 of direct production costs and $19 per ton of brine management costs. This was comparable to last year, despite a much lower operating rate. It is important to highlight that every big producer has its own cost curve, mine by mine, and you can see ours on this slide.', 'When we run our Esterhazy and Belle Plaine mines at optimal rates, as we intend to do in the second half of 2016 with Colonsay down, we can achieve significantly lower costs. Esterhazy is capable of achieving direct production cash cost per ton close to $50 when we eliminate brine management costs in the mid-2020s. And Belle Plaine can produce at approximately $70 per ton. As a reminder, we look at our costs excluding brine expenses because brine management is largely a fixed cost. As you know, we have a plan to eliminate brine expenses over time. Our costs are also well controlled in phosphate, even with lower operating rates.', ""So, we are making good progress, but we're not conserving cash just to weather the market storm. We are mindful that opportunities arise at the low points of the cycle and especially when the low point lasts longer than usual. Of course, we will maintain our strategic discipline as we consider potential opportunities."", ""In total, yes, the business environment is challenging, but we believe in the bright future of this industry and of Mosaic. We are managing aggressively to ensure the company's competitiveness for now and for better markets. It is in times like this that management can make a real difference."", ""Now, before we take your questions, I'll ask Rich Mack to provide a bit more detail on the quarter, as well as our guidance.""]",management_discussion,MOS_104619
2216,Richard L. Mack,"['Thanks, Joc. I would like to reiterate the key points made by both Mike and Joc. No doubt, our markets are challenging right now, with prices failing to rise even with strong global demand. That said though, we do expect conditions to improve in the second half of the year. Mosaic has the ability to withstand challenging conditions longer, if necessary, and to thrive as market prices improve.', 'As a reminder, Mosaic has a $2.5 billion liquidity buffer which remains untapped. So we continue to have ample financial flexibility even during this down part of the cycle.', 'The notable items this quarter, which netted out to a negative $37 million or $0.09 a share, included $69 million in after-tax charges that reflect our deliberate focus on reducing spend and preserving cash. We recorded charges for severance, the write-down of the initial construction of a second ammonia barge and for our share of the decision not to pursue a Canpotex port project at Prince Rupert.', ""Now, I'd like to provide a brief review of our results and our expectations for each segment. In Potash, our sales volumes for the second quarter were within our guidance range, which anticipated a lack of shipments to India and China. Prices fell further during the quarter, with Mosaic recording an average realized price of $178 per ton. With uncertainty in China and India now resolved, we expect that the pricing floor is now established, with the third quarter potash prices to be in the range of $160 per ton to $175 per ton, which reflects a heavier mix of lower-priced export sales."", 'As Joc noted, the Colonsay shutdown will lead to a lower operating rate of around 65%. Notwithstanding Colonsay, however, we are maintaining our annual sales guidance of 7.5 million tons to 8.0 million tons of potash. In the second quarter, our Potash gross margin rate was 12%, and 20% excluding Canadian resource taxes. As you know, we have been relentlessly focused on costs, which has helped us maintain reasonable margins during the downturn. In the third quarter, we expect gross margin rate to decline as a result of lower prices and the impact of a lower operating rate.', 'In Phosphates, second quarter sales volumes were well within our guidance ranges as global demand remained strong. Our average realized price came in at the low end of our guidance range while raw material costs also declined. The result was a gross margin rate of 10%, which was in line with our expectations. We expect the gross margin rate in Phosphates to stay around 10% in the third quarter with additional benefit from lower sulphur and ammonia costs, offsetting expected lower realized prices and higher phosphate rock costs. We plan to run our phosphate facilities at a relatively high operating rate in order to meet North American fall demand. Our guidance for third quarter Phosphate sales is 2.4 million tons to 2.7 million tons.', 'In the International Distribution segment, as Mike noted, demand is strong in Brazil and India, and the agricultural situation in both of these key regions remains promising. Our margins in International Distribution continue to be muted by lower fertilizer prices. For the third quarter, we expect International Distribution sales to be in the range of 2.1 million tons to 2.4 million tons and a sequential improvement in profitability with the gross margin dollars per ton in the $15 to $20 range, which assumes a stable real.', ""We have lowered again our full year SG&A guidance to be in the range of $330 million to $350 million, down from the initial guidance of $350 million to $370 million. Just as a reminder, SG&A at Mosaic was $394 million in 2013 prior to the CF and ADM acquisitions. We have also lowered our capital expenditures by an additional $50 million this quarter to a range of $750 million to $850 million, which is in addition to our investment in the Ma'aden joint venture, which was $220 million in 2016."", 'Because of the lower expected earnings, we are revising our effective tax rate guidance to be around 10% for 2016. We have also lowered our expected full year brine management costs from $150 million to $170 million compared to our prior estimate of $160 million to $180 million. Finally, we expect Canadian resource taxes to range from $95 million to $110 million in 2016.', 'To summarize, we continue to benefit from our strong financial foundation and we are pulling the necessary levers to ensure that we can compete across the cycle. We now have the long desired clarity on China and India potash needs. And along with strong global demand and supply adjustments, we believe potash prices have bottomed and we see potential for modest price increases in the second half of the year. In what we believe will be an improving environment, we will continue to assess the market and our respective balance sheet and capital management positions and we will adapt as necessary as the business environment evolves.', ""With that, I'm going to turn the call back over to Joc to moderate our Q&A session.""]",management_discussion,MOS_104619

Let me take them one at a time and I'll probably hand the India second quarter over to Rick [Rick McLellan] and Mike. But let me talk on rock costs. Clearly, on the long-term, we've been able to manage our rock costs extremely well in our Phosphate business. What's happening today is we've run into some, what I would call, short-term geology changes that have meant that the grade or the amount of ore that we're able to pull per ton of mining's decreased at our Four Corners Mine. It's one portion of the mine. We're talking about a decade-long reserves. And sometimes those are variable. Sometimes we hit areas where the rock quality is much higher than we expect, and other times we hit rock quality that's maybe lower than what we expect. We do expect it to be transitory. And on the long-term, we hold with our expectations of superior rock costs."", ""In terms of the ammonia barge, yes, we certainly can move full volumes with one ammonia barge. We have a little less buffer, I guess, would be the way I would put it, and maybe five years or six years from now when we have to have some statutory shutdowns of those barges for repairs, there may be short periods of time where we'll have to come up with different plans.

2224,Mike Rahm,"[""Okay. Good morning, Adam. Yes, why don't I give you some numbers and, Rick, you can provide some color commentary here. Yes, in general, the outlook in India remains very positive. As you know, the monsoon is delivering above average rainfall. Retail prices for DAP are off about 15%. The rupee has been very stable compared to other currencies. And finally, importer margins, given all those parameters, are profitable. So, all the stars and moons are lined up to make import economics work. We're projecting about 5.6 million tons of imports this calendar year in India. First half of the year, they imported 1.8 million. That would leave about 3.8 million tons second half of the year that we think they need to import into the country."", ""And so that's a big number. That's 500,000 tons more than what they did last year which was a very good second half for them. And on the comments here, we mentioned the bunching of demand in the second half of the year.

Those have cleaned themselves out, so we expect good North American and South American demand. A good indicator of South American demand is the fact that our Distribution business took $300 million in prepayments from customers for all fertilizer products, which means that farmers there, it underpins the 32 million ton overall demand forecast that we talked about for Brazil.

And I think we're beginning to see evidence of a price uplift from demand finally coming to the market. Barge prices have increased. C&F price in Brazil has moved up here recently. And we know that raw material prices for sulfur in the third quarter have come down $5, ammonia prices at $2.70 for August, and we don't see much of a threat in terms of any uptick in those, and potentially more downside as well.

We think 2016 will end the year with 1 million tons and probably another reduction in 2017, largely because of the big price discount in North America that's just not as attractive to move tons into North America now.

So, we'll have to make another decision on Colonsay towards the end of the year. Our expectation at this stage is we will bring it up in January as per what we've previously announced. I mean, really the deciding factor there will be how much we think we'll need for our spring season and how well-positioned we are at the end of the year for that spring season. But at this stage, we're expecting we will bring up Colonsay in January."", ""In terms of the dividend, look, at this point, we don't plan to cut our dividend as you've said.

Interestingly enough, we've never really dipped into the liquidity buffer in our history, and we've got over $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. And at the same time, we're reducing our cash spend. So, we're lowering our capital, we're reducing our SG&A. We're maximizing working capital as much as we possibly can.

Right now, we're slightly higher than the upper end of that range, but when you take a look at it as a rating agency would look at it over, call it, a three-year to five-year period of time, we're comfortable with where we're at right now, and obviously we're at the bottom end of the cycle.""]",question_answer,MOS_104619

So, the big thing right now is finishing the shaft sinking, build the loading pockets, build the infrastructure, so that we can start mining at K3. How fast we ramp that up greatly depends on market conditions and what the needs are for product at that stage. So, that I think is going to come in a couple of years when we really know what's going on there.

2280,Edlain Rodriguez,"[""Thank you. Good morning, guys. Just one quick question. Before you've talked about the potential for potash prices to move higher in the near-term, so, like how does the softness in crop prices play a role in farmers' reluctance to either pay up or not, especially in the U.S.?""]",question_answer,MOS_104619
2281,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Edlain. Let me start by just highlighting that, certainly, lower crop prices does impact at least the psychology of fertilizer. Having said that, fertilizer's very affordable to the farmer right now. Our fertilizer to crop price ratio is probably as good as it's been in a long, long time. But recognize that the impact – the soft crops prices are driven by higher yields. And those higher yields means higher fertilizer removed from the soil. And so, that in itself tends to drive higher demand."", ""The other thing I want to highlight on that is we talk about soft crop prices, we normally are talking about corn. If corn acres goes down in the U.S. for instance, they'll probably be replaced by soybean acres and so likely for us, there won't be that big an impact. And also remember, only 30% of fertilizers are used on the corn, wheat, bean complex. The rest is crops like sugar, coffee, which are doing very well."", 'So, with that, Mike, did you want to add anything to that?']",question_answer,MOS_104619
2282,Mike Rahm,"[""Yes. I think that's a good question, and certainly a concern that we have and monitor. I think one of the things, we had a very good run in prices in June and our intelligence tells us that farmers sold pretty heavily into that, as well as probably forward priced some of their 2016 crop. So, I don't think you want to focus too much on current spot prices. Clearly, there's a big crop that's coming in shortly and that's impacting prices now, but there's still a fair amount of uncertainty about what happens in the Southern Hemisphere, particularly with the expectation of a La Niña event and the negative consequences that typically has towards Southern Hemisphere harvest."", ""So, if you look at the 2017 new crop prices, they're still at levels that we think underpin decent demand. And as Joc said, we're very much corn, soybean, wheat-focused and the 30% number Joc referred to is that 30% of the potash worldwide is applied to those three crops. For phosphate, it's about 40%. So, the fact that you're seeing dramatic increases in sugar prices, cotton prices, coffee prices, fruits and vegetables, those are the ones that are going to, I think, provide a very good demand base.""]",question_answer,MOS_104619

Today, we're going to focus on the actions Mosaic is taking so that we can continue to successfully navigate in this market environment. The key concepts we want you to understand are: first, Mosaic's operational flexibility and solid balance sheet give us significant competitive advantages in a prolonged period of softer markets; second, we expect global demand for our products to be healthy, particularly in the second half of the year; and third, this management team has been through a number of cycles, and we have the experience and discipline to position Mosaic for success across the cycle."", ""I know that most of you understand the headwinds that we have been facing, so I won't spend a lot of time belaboring the business environment. Suffice it to say, while the market environment has been challenging for crop nutrients in recent months, we fully understand and accept the cyclicality of our business, and know, from prior history, that this cycle, too, will turn for the better. It's our responsibility to be well-positioned when this happens and to take advantage of opportunities the cycles present."", 'Grain and oilseed prices have stabilized, with the upward trend in recent weeks. In fact, both corn and soybean prices are higher today than they were 12 months ago. El Niño-related weather conditions around the world are creating concern for the current crop, which is driving a rally in soybean prices and firming corn prices.', 'These improvements, along with expectations that U.S. farmers will plant a big crop, underpin our strong fertilizer demand outlook for the remainder of the year, yet fertilizer prices remain low with our average realized prices for potash and phosphates coming in at $207 and $355 per tonne, respectively, in the first quarter. Our realized potash prices have fallen by over $80 per tonne compared with a year ago.', 'Several factors continue to impact fertilizer prices, including: the strong U.S. dollar, especially against key currencies in potash producing countries; ample channel inventories; declining farm incomes; lower raw material costs; perception of oversupply in potash; and deferred purchasing behavior while the market awaits the bellwether potash contact with China.', 'Demand has been slower to materialize than we anticipated. A short period of warm dry weather in Corn Belt in March created an expectation for an early spring, which just did not materialized as we progressed through the quarter. These conditions, taken together, led to a challenging start to the year, as we expected. Mosaic earned $257 million, or $0.73 per share, on revenue of $1.7 billion in our first quarter. Adjusted earnings per share totaled $0.14.', 'In the Potash business, we generated $86 million in operating earnings and reported a gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes. Our Phosphate operating earnings were $18 million, with a gross margin rate of 7%. Phosphate margins were impacted by a smaller in-season rebound in prices than we expected and the timing of raw material costs, which Rich will address in more detail shortly.', ""We continue to expect a strong second half, with improving global demand for the remainder of 2016. North American spring application is in full swing, and we're seeing good indications from other key regions. Demand is high in Brazil, despite the political and economic turmoil. Similarly, in India, a good monsoon season and a constructive nutrient subsidy resolution, including unchanged potash subsidies despite lower market prices are driving strong khareef application."", 'Our outlook for the remainder of the year includes rising demand and respectable shipment volumes, as well as traditional seasonal pricing behavior. The recent run-up in agricultural commodity prices, combined with current nutrient prices, make our products very affordable. In fact, crop nutrients are more affordable today than they have been during the last five years. This gives us confidence in the second half outlook.', ""Now, let's discuss the affirmative steps we're taking to effectively manage our business and the levers that remain available. First, we are benefiting from our work to reduce expenses. Mosaic, today, is a low-cost producer and we are building on this competitive advantage. Two years ago, we announced a plan to obtain $500 million in cost savings. We are on track to achieve that goal, and we are working now to cut costs further."", 'With the current softness in the industry, we plan to reduce support function expenses by an additional $75 million per year, and expect most of the benefit to be realized in 2017. We are actively working on our plans in this area and intend to provide additional information and insights during our next earnings call.', 'We also plan to reduce our capital expenditures for 2016. During our last call, we provided capital guidance of $900 million to $1.1 billion. We are reducing our 2016 guidance to $800 million to $900 million. This reduction will not compromise employee safety or critical sustaining capital needs, but we are deferring or eliminating capital spending where we can.', ""In addition, we plan to continue our work to optimize our asset portfolio. We've made important progress over the last few years, including the sale of Hersey and the shutdown of MOP production at Carlsbad. We have exited underperforming businesses, regions, and assets. And we have curtained production when the markets softened."", 'We will continue to manage our asset base to match supply with global demand environment. This is an area where we will provide more detail, along with cost saving and medium-term capital spending, later this year.', 'At the same time, we are not just battening down the hatches. We are also looking for opportunities to invest, and we will continue to drive a culture of innovation so that Mosaic with continue to lead the industry across all cycles.', 'With that, I will ask Rich Mack to provide insight into our results for the quarter, as well as our guidance for the second quarter. Rich?']",management_discussion,MOS_100614
2299,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thanks, Joc. I'd like to reiterate Joc's key points. Mosaic is committed to maintaining a solid balance sheet because we understand the cyclicality of this business. We do have the ability to withstand difficult market conditions, seek opportunities and emerge strong and ready to outperform in better markets. And make no mistake. Better market will materialize at some point."", ""So, today, I'd like to begin by providing an overview of our results in each segment. In Potash, our shipment volumes came in at the low end of our expectations. We shipped just over 1.5 million tonnes of potash, with demand in North America hampered by weather and cautious purchasing behavior by our customers."", 'Potash prices drifted lower during the quarter, pressured by the seasonally-slow demand, the lack of a China contract, and additional product available in North America. In light of the market dynamics, our Potash gross margin rate of 30%, excluding resource taxes, was respectable. And it demonstrated our significant progress on cost control. We have made the difficult, but necessary, decisions to stop higher-cost production and curtail production elsewhere, and we have reduced spending across the business unit.', 'Our operating rate in Potash was 77%, which was within our guidance range. We are continuing to manage our production to meet customer needs and global demand. With the spring planting season finally in full swing in North America, demand is emerging. We expect global demand to surge when producers reach contracts with Chinese customers, which we expect to occur in the second quarter. Once that contract price has been set, we should see pent-up demand from other regions around the world, most notably India.', 'As a result, we now expect our global shipments for the year to be in the range of 7.5 million to 8.0 million tonnes, with more of those sales occurring in the second half of the year. In fact, our Q2 volume guidance assumes minimal shipments to China and India. We expect prices to remain range-bound, primarily due to the effects of the strong dollar and available global supply.', 'We anticipate average realized prices in the second quarter will be in the range of $180 to $200 per tonne. Prices will continue to put pressure on margins. And our expectation for the second quarter is for the Potash gross margin rate to be in the mid-to-high teens, excluding resource taxes. A sequential decline in realized prices, the negative impact of reduced operating rates, and a $50 reduction in average realized K-Mag prices are the main drivers of reduced segment profitability.', 'In the Phosphate segment, shipment volumes came in at the high end of our guidance at 2.2 million tonnes. Demand was good in Brazil and North America, while demand began to develop in India toward the end of the quarter. Market prices increased $40 per tonne in the first quarter, but we did not see quite the magnitude of improvements we expected, mostly due to the timing of North America planting and an increase in competition from imported product.', ""Lower finished phosphate prices, as well as the timing of raw material pricing, caused our Phosphate gross margin rate to fall below our expectations. We regularly discuss the impact of raw materials on our margin in Phosphates, so I'd like to explain that in a bit more detail now. There is a time lag between purchasing raw materials and selling finished phosphates. It generally takes three to four months for raw materials to move through the finished goods inventory and cost of goods sold and to be recognized in our financials."", 'Recently, finished phosphate prices declined faster than raw materials, leading us to sell higher cost inventory at lower prices, which put pressure on margins. While raw material prices are more stable today and sales volumes are picking up, phosphate prices are under pressure as Brazilians wait out the impact of the recently-strengthened real, while Indian importers are slow to purchase as they draw down inventories. As a result, margins in the second quarter will remain around 10%. We do expect both Brazil and India to import sizable volumes later in the year and also anticipate Phosphate gross margins to return to the high teens in the second half of 2016, where we will see the full benefits of the lower ammonia and sulfur prices.', 'For the second quarter, we expect Phosphate volumes to be in a range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes, with a sequential increase driven by rising seasonal demand. The year-over-year decline reflects our decision not to participate in certain geographies, most recently, for example, India and, to some extent, Brazil, where current offers, in our view, do not reflect favorable economics and ignore current global supply and demand dynamics. Our full-year volume expectations are now in the range of 9.0 million to 9.75 million tonnes, with the decline driven by a slower start to 2016.', 'In the International Distribution segment, volumes were slightly higher than expected. We experienced good demand in India and improving demand Brazil, where access to farm credit began to improve last quarter. The economic and political situation in Brazil remains volatile, to say the least, and it is challenging to precisely forecast how it will affect farmers and farm credit in the months ahead. We are seeing evidence that farmers in Brazil are continuing to plan for big crops, which bodes well for fertilizer demand.', 'We do not expect a meaningful improvement in International Distribution profitability in the second quarter. In fact, our volume guidance reflects a decision not to pursue market share at these lower margins. The recent run-up in soybean prices, however, should help improve the profitability of our Distribution business later in the year.', ""Overall, we expect business conditions to improve in the second half of 2016. The three main drivers for this uptick include: one, as we've said, we expect global demand for potash and phosphate to accelerate in the second half. In fact, we continue to expect global shipments to be near all-time records. Two, as a result of these strong volumes, we expect to see higher operating rates driving lower costs in both our Potash and Phosphate businesses. And three, we expect the competitive environment to level out as the robust U.S. dollar tapers in value compared to other currencies."", ""For example, we've already seen the Brazilian real and the Russian ruble correct to a certain degree, and macroeconomic indicators suggest that further strengthening of those key currencies is not out of the question. Of course, that also means higher dollar-denominated operating cost for us in Canada, but we believe we are well-hedged against short-term Canadian dollar fluctuations. So, as Joc noted, in the current environment, Mosaic is focused on optimizing cash flow by influencing key levers which we have a meaningful degree of control over. This includes: reducing, or altogether eliminating, capital spending; finding ways to further materially reduce operating and support function costs; optimizing Mosaic's portfolio of assets; driving working capital efficiency; and lastly, managing balance sheet targets relative to current liquidity requirements, such as investments and our dividend."", ""So, let's start with capital. As Joc noted, we intend to reduce capital expenditures further this year by deferring, eliminating and reprioritizing investments. We expect CapEx to range from $800 million to $900 million, plus approximately $220 million for the Ma'aden project, which is down significant from where we were projecting three months ago. On a normalized basis, Mosaic will spend roughly $500 million to $550 million in sustaining capital projects. In some years, this number may be higher, while in more challenging years, we will spend less."", ""In addition to typical sustaining capital, today, we have three distinct projects that increase our CapEx requirements to the revised range that I highlighted above. These projects include Esterhazy K3, the Ma'aden joint venture, and Mosaic's next-generation phosphate mine in Florida."", ""Our Ma'aden spending will be concluded in 2017, and we will be allocating some capital for both K3 and the new phosphate mine for the next several years until completed; having said that, however, you should know that we are also evaluating further opportunities to reduce capital spending on the last two projects, as well as additional asset optimization scenarios across our entire organization."", ""To reiterate Joc's points regarding expenses, we are moving quickly and aggressively to reduce support function costs. We are targeting an annual run rate savings of $75 million, the majority of which should be captured in calendar year 2017. A portion will also be realized in 2016, which is, in part, driving a reduction in full-year SG&A expenses, now expected to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million, down from $350 million to $370 million provided earlier in the year. We expect to have more detail on these initiatives on our second quarter earnings call."", ""Our balance sheet remains a source of strength and resilience. Our strong liquidity buffer of $2.5 billion exists for us to use when necessary for protection in difficult parts of the cycle. Our balance sheet strength also allows us to remain committed to our dividend in today's market environment."", 'So, to summarize, we have built Mosaic, its operations, its talent base and its financial foundation to succeed across cycles in a business that we know to be cyclical. We are taking the actions necessary to adapt to this environment and to ensure Mosaic remains in a strong position, regardless of the market environment. We will continue to actively assess and manage our balance sheet and we will adapt, as necessary, should the down part of the cycle be longer or more pronounced than expected.', 'Now, I will turn the call back over to Joc for his concluding remarks.']",management_discussion,MOS_100614
2300,James C. O'Rourke,"['Thank you, Rich. At Mosaic, we are focused on what we can control. And we are executing during what we view to be the bottom of the cycle.

We are executing all the good strategic moves we've made since 2013, driving innovation across the company and looking for opportunities to take advantage of our relative strength.

That being said, we believe once the normal flow starts, i.e., once the Chinese contract is in place, once India starts buying and they get a contract in place, the demand gets sopped up pretty darn quickly, and that everybody goes back to more normal operating rates. So, when you ask the long-term, our expectations are Canpotex and Mosaic will continue to match global demand with our available production, as we have in the first quarter.

Second question is any thoughts on how India's pending phosphoric acid settlement will impact the region's desire to import that versus producing the product locally?

2364,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Okay. There's three there. Thanks, Sandy. There's three there. I'm going to try and get all three.

We have just completed a $225 million increase in capacity at our New Wales plant, which will give us the capacity to produce 3.5 million tonnes."", ""As per the earlier question about the economics of buying fertilizer, we believe the economics of using MicroEssentials is better than it's ever been because of the challenging market, not despite the challenging market. So, I would say, first of all, we expect the careful producer will be doing everything they can to increase yield per acre, which includes using the best quality premium products, which would be like our MicroEssentials product or our K-Mag or any of those products that tend to bring on better yield."", ""In terms of P2O5 to India, I'm going throw that straight over to Rick.""]",question_answer,MOS_100614
2365,Richard N. McLellan,"[""Yeah. Good morning. With P2O5, with the acid contract into India, I think there's already been contracts closed into Europe that are at higher levels. I think how the Indian producers think about their phosphoric acid contract is they're producing more NPKs because that allows them to maximize their return from the subsidy.

2368,Yonah Weisz,"[""Hi there. Thanks for taking the question. A question actually is on your balance sheet, and on some ideas of capital allocation. In the past, you've talked about keeping a $1 billion cash buffer on your balance sheet. There's a chance, I guess, with lower profits and good amount of capital spending, that you may eat into that buffer and go lower than $1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. So, I guess I'm curious to know how low can you go or do you want to go below that $1 billion mark for cash on the balance sheet before something critical happens, like you have to, for example, perhaps cut a dividend or take some serious cuts into your capital spending?""]",question_answer,MOS_100614
2369,James C. O'Rourke,"[""Well, thank you, Yonah. Let me quickly touch on this, and then I'll hand it to Rich for a second. But the liquidity buffer we carry is $2.5 billion, and exactly what the name implies, it is a buffer for short-term liquidity.

But if our cash needs exceed our short-term generation, we will dip into that buffer."", 'Rich, do you want say anything on that?']",question_answer,MOS_100614
2370,Richard L. Mack,"[""Yeah. Yonah, I would say that you should just think of what our end goal here is to have about $2.5 billion of total available liquidity, and that can be comprised of either cash on balance sheet or available revolver capacity. And so, at times, that will fluctuate up and down. Today, we still have a very strong cash balance on our balance sheet.

I know there's at least one other company reporting today, so we don't want to cut into their time. Look, we fully expect the markets to strengthen as the year progresses. With that said, year-to-date, our production rates are down, consistent with our intention to balance production with sales and global demand."", ""I want to highlight some positive steps, though, that we've taken to reduce our spending, so that Mosaic can weather this current environment and thrive across the cycle. We've held our production costs flat year-over-year in Potash, despite a 16% reduction in our operating rate. This represents good cost management, as well as some currency benefits. I want to point out our brine inflow cost, while somewhat dependent on Mother Nature, these are down by $70 million to $90 million from the peak, largely due to good cost control, good technology application and some currency benefits."", ""In Phosphates, we've driven our conversion cost lower, despite a significant lower operating rate. And we've held the cash costs of our mining operations flat over several years. We attribute both of those to good cost management. We've reduced our annual capital spending expectations this year by $200 million plus deferred almost $100 million in spending for Ma'aden. Our SG&A costs are down 10% year-over-year, as lower incentives are driven by our performance. And our performance reflect the challenging market environment. And we've lowered our full-year SG&A guidance. This clearly demonstrates the benefits of our work to continue to be the low-cost producer in potash and phosphates."", 'So, with that, I want to conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. We have the operating flexibility and balance sheet we need to weather to current market environment. We fully expect the markets to improve in the second half of this year.

2375,James O'Rourke,"['Good morning, thank you for joining us for our fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings call. It seems clear to us that you’ll understand the market related challenges we face. To summaries, we’re experiencing a major decline in the broader commodities markets as well as global economic uncertainty and unprecedented strengths of the U.S. dollar.', 'Agriculture, the grain and oil seed supply and demand situation remains relatively balanced. Even after three consecutive huge harvests and despite the severe price decline across other commodities, crop prices have been relatively stability. Unlike hard commodities we do not see a structural imbalance in agriculture. So, we’ve a positive outlook for the 2016 global shipments in both potash and phosphates. We believe recent price declines in potash and phosphates have been driven more by macroeconomic trend then by the current supply and demand balance. Weak currency valuations against the U.S. dollar are low in production costs for exporting nations and raising prices for importing nations. Normal seasonal pressures are exacerbating the fertilizer price trends. As a result our realized prices were down in the fourth quarter and have been under increasing pressure since the beginning of this year.', 'We see several factors that are giving farmers around the globe and centers to use fertilizers to maximize yield and revenue per acre. The price declines in fertilizers have led to high crop nutrient affordability. Farmers are experiencing lower energy costs. Currency valuations are providing tailwinds for non-U.S. growers, selling U.S. dollar price crops. And the reasons to big harvests have withdrawn large amounts of nutrients from the soil which must be replenished. As a result demand is expected to remain strong.', 'Without operating environment as a backdrop, we’ve three important concepts to discuss today. First, we expect Mosaic to emerge as stronger company from this difficult period. Second, the resilience we build into our business is real as demonstrated by the strength of our balance sheet, our cost control and our strong execution. We believe it will yield compelling opportunities for growth as this cycle plays out. And third, agricultural commodities bear different dynamics than many other commodities and that’s a fact that we believe has been overlooked amid the general commodity market pessimism. Cycles can turn more quickly in agriculture because of unpredictable weather and the consistent underlying global demand for food.', 'We understand the cycles are inevitable and that they’re neither tidy nor predictable. We’ve always managed Mosaic for the long term for success across the business cycle that is a lot easier to say then it is to do. So let’s explore the characteristics of our franchise that we believe will allow us to emerge ahead of our competition as the business improves.', 'First, the earnings we reported today show our resilience. We reported $0.44 per share or $0.53 per share excluding notable items and a catch up in our tax accruals. This catch up was a result of higher accrual to the first three quarters of the year and a trump in this quarter, which resulted in a low effective tax rate in the quarter.', ""For the full year we earned $1 billion and our earnings per share of $2.78 were higher than the $2.68 per share Mosaic earned in 2014, reflecting both our execution and our capital allocation. It is important to note that Mosaic remains solidly profitable and free cash flow positive despite the very tough markets. We have taken the actions necessary to ensure stability. We made tremendous progress on costs. We are well ahead of schedule on our initiative to generate $500 million of cost savings by 2018. It's important to note that we began that work with Mosaic already occupying competitive cost positions on the global potash, and phosphate cost curves. We have made tough decisions including difficult moves to stop our MOP production at Carlsbad New Mexico and decommission our potash mine in Hersey Michigan."", 'We have also saved significant cost through innovative decisions and by investing the necessary capital to improve processes for the long-term. We have made major progress towards a strong and efficient balance sheet. We have reached our leverage targets while maintaining enough cash to provide a buffer. That seem conservative to some no doubt but it will prove prudent and provide flexibility others do not have in this environment.', 'In 2012 when potash prices where close to $450 per ton we in-definitively postponed a $3 billion potash expansion. Two years ago we had the opportunity to contract for ammonia with natural gas base prices and decided to fore grow building a $1.2 billion ammonia plant. We took that capital and returned it to shareholders, retiring nearly a quarter of our outstanding shares since we were split off from Cargill.', ""And we are executing at a very high level. Our plants and mines are efficient we have had very little unplanned downtime and as an indicator of our effectiveness we delivered another year of record low reportable injury frequency. To put it simply we have not built the company just to weather storms. We have built it to succeed across the cycles that we all know will come. We have also created a great deal of potential. And that's why we believe so strongly that Mosaic will emerge a winner. We expect to realize the value of our many growth initiatives across the cycle and we believe we have created a tremendous amount of leverage for when better conditions arrive. We have covered our many growth initiatives in the past."", 'So, I will provide you with a short update. The Esterhazy K3 potash mine remains on schedule and on budget when the project is completed the mine will be amongst the lowest cost most efficient mines in the world. It will give us important operating flexibility including the ability at some point to fully eliminated material brain management costs.', 'The CF phosphate acquisition has exceeded our expectations. Those facilities generated excellent margins for the first 18 months we owned them. The ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay continues to hold significant promise. The current difficult economic and political situation in Brazil is temporary muting the benefit we expect.', 'Our work to ensure stable, cost effective access to our phosphate raw materials is nearing completion. We have finished the sulfur smelter project in our new wells facility in Florida and our ammonia supply agreement with CF begins next year. While the economics in the near term are less attractive with $310 per ton ammonia long term economics remain highly positive.', ""Also at New Wales, our project to increase micro-essentials capacity is nearing completion. We will have the ability to make 3.5 million tones of micro-essentials which provides significant value to the farmers, the retailers and to Mosaic. Wa'ad Al Shamal Phosphate project in Saudi Arabia is also progressing and we expect initial production of ammonia later this year. Taken together all this work is Mosaic’s resilience and potential which in turn gives us the opportunity to emerge from the weak part of the cycle in the lead."", 'Now I will turn the call over to Rich Mack for insights into our financial results and our guidance. Rich?']",management_discussion,MOS_96137
2376,Richard Mack,"['Thank you Joc, and good morning to you all. To briefly reiterate Joc’s commentary on the markets, our financial results are being impacted by a confluence of challenging factors. Global macroeconomic uncertainty, ongoing currency volatility and weakness in key currencies against the U.S. dollar, the lack of sufficient credit in Brazil and in potash it recently completed Canpotex proving run that added supply in the seasonally slow part of the year.', 'Over the longer term though, we see cause for optimism including a balance supply and demand picture in phosphates, a manageable supply in demand picture in potash, and good conditions for agriculture in Brazil where the weak riyal leads to high prices in local currency for grains and oil seeds.', 'Now, I will provide an overview of results in each of our three operating segments. In phosphates, our margins were lower in the fourth quarter primarily because of timing. We were selling fertilizer manufacture when raw material prices were higher than they are today. At the same time prices dropped quickly as traders anticipated the impact of lower raw material costs and buyer delayed purchasing. So, for the near term we are seeing seasonally limited sales volume and softer prices before we can realize our lower raw material costs. These trends are expected to continue into the first quarter.', 'If we look longer term however our [strength] margin is expected to remain healthy with much lower raw material prices offsetting lower fertilizer prices. We expect continue declines in sulfur reflecting a number of curtailments announcements in China as well as our own. These low raw materials costs combined with a firming of phosphate prices in the spring leads us to expect margin rates to rebound to normal levels after the first quarter.', 'In the first quarter we expect the seasonally slow sales to continue in raw material cost to fall further. Last week we announced that we are once again curtailing production to avoid the building of high cost inventory. As a result we expect our phosphate operating rates to be in the range of 70% to 80%. These factors are all embedded assumptions in our phosphate guidance. It is noteworthy that sales volumes picked up after we announced our decision to reduce production.', 'For the full year we expect margins to be similar to last year underpinned by our constructive view of the industry. We expect to ship between 9 million and 10 million tones of phosphates with global market shipments increasing yet again this year to a range of 65 million to 67 million tones. In the potash segment we remained solidly profitable despite the drop in prices. Our works to reduce costs, as well as the tailwinds provided by the weak Canadian dollar have enabled us to maintain reasonable margins.', 'Looking back at potash supply and demand, in the later part of 2014 customers built significant inventories with the expectations of a drawdown in 2015 that inventory reduction occurred to some extent, but it was less pronounced than we had expected.', 'Heading into the 2016 planting season in North America, we expect strong demand in good shipment levels tempered by the fact that retailers continue to hold higher inventories. As a result of these factors we have lowered our estimate of global potash shipment by 3 million tones to a range of 58 million to 60 million tones consistent with 2015, which was a second highest year of shipments ever. We do not believe the potash supply and demand scenario is grossly out of balance. Many producers including Mosaic have cut back volumes in response to the seasonal lack of demand.', 'Per our earlier production curtailment announcements we reduced our operating rate in the fourth quarter by about 20 percentage points compared to last year. In the first quarter we planned to operate our potash mines at approximately 70% to 80% of capacity in order to meet global demand we expect to emerge during the second quarter. We expect pent up demand to come from most of our major markets, China, Brazil, India, Southeast Asia and North America as well as from Europe. All at roughly the same time this year which should provide a solid foundation for prices. In the mean time we will maintain our disciplined approach to meeting our customers’ demands.', 'We have operational flexibility, a low cost structure including the benefit of low natural gas prices at [Belpoint] solution mine and the benefit of a weak Canadian dollar which in 2015 was down as much as the Russian ruble against the U.S. dollar. Our first quarter potash volume guidance anticipates demand emerging around the world toward the end of this quarter and as a result our expected operating rate is well below the same period last year.', ""Margins are expected to be on the low to mid 20% range reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to produce only to expected market demand. We expect our shipments to North America to be about flat with last year's levels with the reduction in volumes primarily a function of delayed demand in the export markets. Our full year volume guidance of 7.5 million to 8.5 million tones reflects an expected increase in Canpotex potash exports."", 'In our international distribution segment we continue to be impacted by the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Fertilizer demand remains slower than usual primarily because farmers are having difficulty find appropriate access to credit. The credit situation is giving farmers incentive to acquire their inputs through border, a system that can benefit Mosaic because of our strong relationships with key players in the Brazilian border market. These arrangements also allow us to take a conservative approach to granting credit which lowers overall credit losses.', 'Farmers in Brazil continue to plant for big crops, in fact, a high percentage of second crop corn already has been sold in advance because of the favorable currency dynamics. So farmers need to plant their acres and maximize the yields. We believe that will facilitate additional fertilizer demand.', 'Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume guidance assumptions for the first quarter and full year because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per ton as does the higher proportion of micro-essentials in our sales.', 'Finally, I should note that our forecasted margins anticipate relative stability in the Real. For 2016 we expect our distribution volumes to range from six to seven million tones. For calendar 2016 our annual guidance ranges are as follows.', ""Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $180 million to $220 million, down from $281 million in 2015. Brine management costs are expected to be consistent with 2015 in the range of $160 million to $180 million. Our SG&A expense is estimated to be $350 million to $370 million. We will continue to look for opportunities to take additional costs out of the system to increase cash flow and to manage the company for the inevitable cyclical upturn. Our effective tax rate is expected to be in the high teen percentage range. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range from $900 million to $1.1 billion plus around $300 million for our interest in the modern Wa'ad Al Shamal Phosphate Company."", 'As we have previously guided approximately $600 million of our capital expenditures is sustaining capital and the majority of the remainder is for projects already well underway. We are prepared to calibrate capital spending further to reflect current market conditions. Given the current attractiveness of Mosaic share price new capital commitments must meet a very high risk adjusted hurdle rate.', ""And one more note on capital. Today we announced an accelerated share repurchase program of $75 million. As you know, cycles bring opportunities and during the fourth quarter we were evaluating some unique opportunities and didn't affect additional share repurchases. We are pleased to be in a position to make today's announcement and we will continue to embrace the capital management philosophy we have often articulated in the past."", ""To conclude I would like to reiterate Joc's main points. There is no doubt that markets are challenge on several fronts but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have the financial and operational resilience and discipline to succeed in weak markets and we have significant leverage to outperform as conditions improve which they always do in this sector."", 'With that I will return the call back to Jack for his closing comments.

2381,Michael Rahm,"['Sure. Let me start with the second question first in terms of Chinese export I am sure you are all aware of that exports spiked in 2015 to, I believe the China customers numbers in the 11.6 million ton range. As I think was noted earlier there have been some shut downs in China. Those tones we think will be lost our projection that we are using right now in our S&D is somewhere in that 10 million ton range we think it will be off a bit from the record last year.', ""In terms of the first question phosphate inventories and Rich you should comment as well. I think it varies from region to region certainly continuing in China, we know that inventories have built up at the plant level. We think they are high there. Distributors in China are the same as distributors around the world in terms of when prices are trending down they tend not to take position, so we have seen a back up of inventories at the plant. But overall, we don't think inventories in china are excessive. The situation India maybe a little bit different. They had 2.5 million ton increase in imports last year and we think that inventories there are certainly greater than what they have been in the last couple of years when they were pulled down to very low levels. North America I think is in good shape. And in terms of Brazil inventories ended the year maybe a little bit above average but I think we are seeing some positive signs there that things are beginning to move."", 'So I will let Rick provide his color commentary as well.']",question_answer,MOS_96137

I just spent some time going through with our Brazilian team something that are happening in the marketplace there and we have seen since the start of the year some pretty significant moves of volumes that had weighted to come to market, so these are blended volumes that are going out. And we see the phosphate inventories frankly being drawn down Mike described them as a both even year-over-year, but the sales that are going on right now for the first quarter reflect farmers coming back in to that marketplace. So I think those inventories get drowned down and we just finished spending time this week with some of our larger North American customers and I would say their buying is probably lower than it's been for the last three years. They are going to wait and move hand them out and so they are not sitting on a lot of inventories, there is not a lot of inventories sitting in North America and so we expect when the season hits us both is very well.

So, we are certainly not going to specify how we plan to do that but we expect to make sure that our production meets expected demand and that's why our guidance this year is 70% to 80% in the first quarter and it was about 70% in the fourth quarter against last year we operated 91% in the fourth quarter and 90% in the first quarter.

There was question about our third quarter volume into North America and frankly we saw those volumes come back in the fourth quarter. I think the one thing that people don't understand is our program separates price from shipment and so it allows the dealer to put product into place, but the pricing mechanism is they can buy up to the moment they sell to the farmer.

This year we are the tail-end of modern as well as what I would say 2016 will represent the vast majority of our remaining expenditures there I think we are suggesting about $300 million in 2016 there could be some spillover effect that goes into 2017 and that you have to be determined based on variety factors in terms of how the construction is progressing today. Joc noted ammonia production comes online later this year. Phosphate production will come online sometime during 2017, but there will be a ramp up period. And we are progressing I would say very quickly right now in terms of the constructions process and those time horizons are still generally consistent with what we thought about couple of years ago.', ""Your question about the [indiscernible] the positive contribution in the corporate segment really relates to intercompany eliminations between our phosphate segment and our international distribution segment. So when we sell phosphates to international distribution primarily Brazil, we do not take, we back off the profit or the profit is recognized I should say in the phosphate segment and then it's eliminated in the corporate segment until that product is sold by international distribution. So what you are seeing here is product that moved in the fourth quarter out of international distribution and therefore the profit is fully being recognized by Mosaic."", ""And then I think your third question was an increase in other current assets and I think the answer to that is primarily additional FPDs this year compared to the last relevant period so I hope that's response to your question.""]",question_answer,MOS_96137

I have no idea what the subsidy will be for P&K in India, but it will be lower.', 'And I think the other piece that the inventory built up for a couple of reasons and I think the biggest one was that the expectations for demand last year were little higher than people than what ended up happening. The impact of the drought in India impacted both P and K usage and right now what we are seeing in country with our own in country business is product is moving from the distributor shelf to the farmers. And so we have to separate what happens on the import side from what happens on the distributor shelf.

We have probably about three to $600 million to spend over the next three years, at Esterhazy for the other equipment, like the conveyors, the shaft and development around the shaft."", ""So, I would say those are the expected and then there is a net tax effect.

2444,James O'Rourke,"['Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter earnings conversation. This morning, I will discuss current market conditions, and then Rich Mack will review our financials and provide our guidance. Before we take your questions, I will provide closing remarks.', 'Mosaic delivered solid results in our seasonally slow third quarter despite a variety of market based challenges. There are three points I want you to know. First, demand for our products remains strong in most parts of the world. We understand investor concerns regarding future potash supply and I will address the supply and demand picture for you shortly. Second, Mosaic continues to execute at a very high level and effectively allocate capital. We are focused on capturing the value of our investments. To put it simply, we believe Mosaic is in an excellent position with significant upside when market sentiments and conditions improve. And third, Mosaic has displayed market leadership and a thoughtful production philosophy for many years. We will continue to pursue a strategy to maximize value.', 'For the quarter Mosaic earned $160 million on net sales of $2.1 billion, compared with earnings of $202 million on net sales of $2.3 billion in the third quarter of 2014. We reported earnings per share of $0.45 this quarter compared to $0.54 a year ago.', ""Adjusted for notable items, primarily the non-cash impact of foreign exchange rates, Mosaic's earnings increased over 10% to $0.62 per share, compared to $0.56 per share last year. Our higher year-over-year adjusted earnings per share despite tougher markets reflect successful cost control efforts, the lower share count resulting from our active share repurchase activities and a lower effective tax rate."", ""So let me turn to the markets, which are quite different from country-to-country, and from product-to-product. The one constant around the world however, for both potash and phosphate is that demand remains strong. We expect total global phosphate shipments to set a new record, and total global potash shipments to decline slightly this year compared with last year's record. That is an important point, demand for fertilizer is underpinned by demand for food and we have no doubt that this demand will continue to grow along with world population."", ""Even if supply outpaces demand for a short period of time, demand will continue its steady upward trajectory. We're seeing this now in the day-to-day operations of farmers all around the world."", 'Going into each of the last several application seasons, market sentiment has been negative with forecasters expecting significant lower fertilizer applications and each season has exceeded expectations for several reasons.', 'First, high nutrient removal rates from the recent record global harvests have required growers to replenish their soils. Second, grain and oilseed prices have remained stable. And third, fertilizers remain necessary and affordable.', 'In addition, challenging macroeconomic factors are not having significant impacts on demand. For example, in Brazil, where the economic and political situation remains volatile, 2015 is expected to be the second best year in history for fertilizer demand.', 'Demand has also remained strong in other key countries, including China and India. Currency devaluation against the dollar have both positive and negative impacts on agribusiness. A strong dollar is a net positive for agricultural regions like Brazil that are large exporters. Growers can pay for many imports in local currency and sell their grains and oilseeds in dollars.', 'In North America, the fall application season is meeting our expectations. Potash shipments to North America in 2015 are expected to be lower than last year, mostly because of built up in retail inventories we saw at the end of 2014. Retailers are working through inventories now, and we are seeing evidence that inventories are reaching low levels.', 'Supply is a different story, and we realize that concerns about future oversupply are driving current equity valuations. We have maintained and we continue to maintain our philosophy to match supply with expected demand, as our decision to curtail production at our Colonsay potash mines demonstrates. It is also worth noting that most of the additional potash supply that is expected to come to market is still years away, so demand will have some time to catch up.', ""Let's put this into context for Mosaic. We have two attractive businesses that are of similar size, in markets expected to experience long-term secular growth. In Potash, we've taken actions to right-size our operations and reduce cost. We are confident in our ability to manage through, if not take advantage of, the current market dynamics."", ""In Phosphates, we've also taken out cost and made significant investments that solidify our leadership position. We believe these investments will continue to drive growth in the years to come. The Phosphates business continues to generate attractive margins and demand is strong."", 'We are ahead of schedule in our work to achieve $500 million in cost savings across the company. And this work is visible on our bottom line. This slide tells the story. Third quarter adjusted earnings per share were higher this year than in 2014, despite lower product prices and overall revenue. Our strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, capacity enhancements, decisions to exit or curtail underperforming assets, and substantial capital returned to shareholders, are delivering the benefits we anticipated.', 'While macroeconomic and agricultural market conditions remain challenging, Mosaic remains in an excellent position to continue to reap the benefits of these initiatives, and has significant leverage to the upside when this market turns more positive.', 'Now I will ask Rich to provide more insights into our results and our guidance for the fourth quarter.']",management_discussion,MOS_92084
2445,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thank you, Joc. I'll begin today with an overview of our three operating segments. The Phosphates segment continued to generate good results and strong margins. Mosaic's Phosphates shipment volumes for the quarter fell slightly below our expectations with delayed Brazilian demand and cautious buying behavior in North America being a big part of the story. As Joc noted, the global phosphate market remains balanced, and the relatively stable margins support that statement. Cost control, including low cash rock mining costs, continues to be a margin driver."", 'In the Potash segment, our results reflect lower production levels during a seasonally slow demand period when we traditionally take maintenance shutdowns. Having said that, our 20% gross margin rate in this segment reflects excellent cost control. Despite an operating rate of 67%, we produced MOP at a cash cost per tonne of just $105 including $20 per tonne in brine management costs, down 21% from a year ago.', 'In the International Distribution segment, results were better than expected, especially in light of the difficult political and economic situation in Brazil. Gross margin per tonne was $30, which is $4 per tonne above the high end of our guidance range. This quarter we sold more tonnes of product than last year at higher than expected margins capturing time-place utility and leveraging our fixed costs.', ""Now, I'd like to address our capital management. We have repurchased roughly $700 million of Mosaic stock or 15 million shares since the beginning of the year. We repurchased $75 million of our shares during the third quarter in the open market, have over $900 million remaining under our share repurchase authorization, and will continue to be prudent about our share repurchases in the future."", 'We will continue to manage capital carefully and embrace a balanced approach in our allocation across growth initiatives both organic and inorganic as well as shareholder distributions. This is a cyclical business, and the most compelling opportunities present themselves at the bottom of the cycle. With that said, our share price in the mid-$30 range creates a high bar for investments other than our own stock.', ""Now let's move on to our guidance for the fourth quarter. You can clearly see the guidance on the current slide, so unlike prior quarters, I won't go through the details and instead focus on assumptions, risks and opportunities. In Phosphates we anticipate that both the upside and the downside on sales volumes will come from North America, which will represent a higher proportion of expected sales in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter."", 'If you recall, earlier in the year, we diverted tonnes that were destined for North America to the export market, which Mosaic and our size, has the ability to do. As the fall season progresses, our guidance assumes more tonnes will be needed here domestically. We expect relatively stable margins in the fourth quarter as lower realized prices are largely offset by lower raw material costs.', 'In our International Distribution business, Brazilian credit availability is the swing factor in our volume assumptions for the fourth quarter. Because of the relatively high proportion of fixed costs, higher volumes positively impact margins per tonne, as does a higher proportion of MicroEssentials in our sales. Finally, swings in the Brazilian reais have an impact on local currency costs. Our forecasted margins do not anticipate any appreciable strengthening in the reais.', ""In Potash, our volume guidance is below last year's levels because, unlike last year, we do not expect dealers in North America to build inventories late in the year. Similar to Phosphates, albeit to a lesser extent, we expect higher sales volumes domestically compared to the quarter we just finished. These assumptions are incorporated into our pricing guidance."", ""Margins are expected to be in the mid-20% range, reflecting both lower realized prices and our decision to hold back production to match market demand. The mechanical failure at our Esterhazy K1 shaft is expected to take three weeks to four weeks to repair, and we have accelerated other work that was originally planned to occur during a maintenance shutdown in December. As a result, we don't expect this event to impact our sales in the fourth quarter or impact our ability to meet expected demand in early 2016."", 'For the remainder of 2015, our annual guidance ranges are as follows: Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $265 million to $295 million, down from $310 million to $350 million. Brine management costs have also been revised down to the range of $170 million to $180 million from $180 million to $200 million.', 'Capital expenditures and investments are now expected to range from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from $1.1 billion to $1.3 billion. Our SG&A expense range is now estimated to be $350 million to $370 million, down from $360 million to $380 million. And our effective tax rate expectations were lowered to be in the mid to high teens range.', 'Our outlook for 2016 includes the expectation of stability in our markets based on growing demand. Demand for our products is not predicated upon construction of bridges and roads in China, but on the need to eat. We expect demand for our products to grow. The rate of growth will vary from year-to-year, but over time, we are confident in a 2% to 3% average annual growth rate. Our first look at 2016 producer shipments is yet another example of this trend.', 'The issues we face are not demand driven, as demand in 2016 is expected to be the second highest on record. The concern we hear about, the new supply many investors worry about, is fairly limited until 2017. During the next two years, we expect demand to continue to grow and over a longer period of time we expect demand to consume much of the excess supply.', 'In the meantime, Mosaic will continue to embrace our operating philosophy of producing only what is needed by our customers.', ""So, I would like to summarize my comments by reiterating Joc's main point earlier. There is no doubt that markets are challenging on several fronts, but Mosaic has made and will continue to make notable progress. We have a realistic market outlook and are taking actions to position the company to excel."", ""With that, I'll return the call back to Joc for his closing comments.

And in particular, if you look at India and their increase in DAP imports, those have increased 3.1 million tonnes during the same period, so – and particularly, if you look at China's phosphate exports and look at just the DAP component, DAP exports have increased 2.7 million tonnes, Indian DAP imports have increased 3.1 million tonnes. So there is a draw coming from India that China is meeting."", ""The other thing I think that we've said before is that on the demand side, we see very steady growth in phosphate demand. And on the supply side, there are really some very interesting dynamics taking place. While China has increased their exports, if you look at other major producers, there have been some real significant declines in supply."", ""So, in North America, we've had two facilities close down, so we've had the full impact of the closure of Mississippi Phosphates this year, so another 700,000 tonnes lost there. We've had the – a full-year impact of the White Springs plant closing. And then if you look around the world, there have been outages or hiccups in many different countries, whether it's Tunisia with some of the political unrest there that has disrupted production, whether it's in – just some hiccups in places like Jordan, South Africa, Senegal, Mexico, you name it. There have been supply disruptions. And then, in terms of the bigger players like Ma'aden, Ma'aden I, continues to ramp up. It still hasn't reached full capacity. So it's sort of leveled off at two-thirds of capacity, if you will. And the Moroccans are bringing on capacity but at a much slower rate than expected. Whether that's planned or unplanned, who knows. But the bottom line is, their first hub just started up a few months ago. And as we understand, the granulation plant is not running there yet."", ""And secondly, if you look at some of the other hubs, they're not scheduled to come on for several months or even years. And I think all of that is evident when you look at margins. In this business, we're focused on what we call the stripping margin."", ""And the difference between the price of DAP and the price of sulfur and ammonia in a tonne of DAP – and if you look at that, margins in the fourth quarter, and if you calculate them based on current spot prices that are published, they're up about $40 from a year ago. And if you look at margins throughout calendar year 2015, they have been incredibly constant at between about $265 and $275 per tonne.

So, I think we'll start 2016 with the pipeline in much better shape than certainly a year ago."", ""And then in addition to that, I think – we've been saying what has really pressured potash prices this year are two factors: one, being the channel inventories; the second, being the collapse of key potash currencies.

And then, if these forecasts are on target, we should see about a 3 million tonne rebound, we think, in shipments.

In your comments at the start of this call, you talked about Mosaic's balance sheet and ability to use the balance sheet, thinking about new opportunities at the low point in the cycle. Earlier on this year at Mosaic's Investor Day, your predecessor, Jim, was asked I think a similar question about use of balance sheet and perhaps M&A, and he implied that really no chance for M&A in potash and maybe here or there a few bolt-on acquisitions in phosphates."", ""On other hand, if you're talking about use of balance sheet, I'm wondering is there a change in philosophy at Mosaic with regards to M&A?

2487,James O'Rourke,"[""Sure. Look, our capital philosophy, Yonah, has not changed in the last year. We're certainly looking first at making sure we maintain a reasonable liquidity buffer, that we keep our credit rating in really good shape, that we meet our debt ratios that we have set, the 1.5 times to 2 times EBITDA to debt. So none of that has changed. And as we've probably said, at the bottom of cycles, that really opens up, let's say, more opportunities. There's more things out there that look like they might be well-priced for the people who have the balance sheet to take advantage of it."", ""But as Rich said in his comments, I would emphasize that when we trade – when our stock is trading low like this, our bar becomes even higher because we have to measure any expenditure against the benefit of buying back our own shares.

I think we've said in the past, I mean, the fair comparison is looking at the blend grade price delivered to the U.S. Gulf as well as Brazil. And if you look at current spot prices, you're exactly right that that differential has more or less dissipated. In particular, if you look at a NOLA barge price of $270 per short tonne versus a Brazil C&F price of roughly $290. For the Russian or Belarusian supplier, Brazil actually gives them a little bit better netback."", ""So, I would say that, yes, we've seen some adjustments in that – in prices to sort of turn off the beacon in terms of attracting tonnes to North America. And I think that's certainly evident in terms of our price – our import forecast. If you look at the 2014-2015 fertilizer year, the U.S. imported about 1.7 million metric tonnes of MOP from offshore sources. And not only Russians, but every potash producer around the globe seemed to place a few tonnes in the U.S. We think that's going to drop about 600,000 tonnes to 1.1 million, 1.0 million tonnes this year."", ""And one of the main reasons for that is the dissipation of that differential. And if you look at the numbers for the first three months of our fertilizer year, namely the third calendar quarter, imports are down about 150,000 tonnes from last year. So we're on a pace to reduce imports from offshore sources by the amount that we have. And then, again, if global shipments increase 3 million tonnes, there's going to be kind of a natural pull of some of these tonnes that have come into North America into other markets that are better markets for them."", ""And then your second question in terms of long-term Chinese exports: obviously, we've seen a big surge this year, driven largely by the rebound in Indian demand as well as the supply problems that we talked about earlier. I think longer term, we expect that those are not going to be in that 10 million tonne range, but probably something closer to 6 million, 7 million tonnes."", 'We think there will be structural adjustments that take place in the Chinese phosphate industry. Chinese producers are very heterogeneous in the sense that there are some very efficient low-cost players, there are some medium-cost players, and there are some high-cost players.

So the product that is being shipped is going to the ground."", ""And indications on the impact of VAT have been frankly de minimis from what we've been able to pick up.

We have a very comprehensive process for doing what we call integrated business planning.

Now clearly, if the market requires it and we see it as adding real value to our shareholders, we will add production. But as Rick said earlier today on one of the earlier questions, there is very little value in selling into a market when there's no demand. And in the third quarter, it's just refilling, it's just getting ready for the fall application season.

2507,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Well, good morning. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion. We will take a slightly different approach today. I will review our results and discuss current market conditions, and then Rich Mack will provide financial insight and our guidance. Before we take your questions, Joc O'Rourke who will succeed me as Mosaic's CEO effective tomorrow, will provide the outlook for the second half of 2015."", ""Let's get right to it. Our results for the quarter provide a glimpse of what today's Mosaic can accomplish with even small improvements in agricultural market conditions. We have three key messages for you today. First, the many strategic moves we've undertaken over the past couple of years have created substantial earnings leverage for Mosaic. Second, we are executing our strategy across our operations almost flawlessly. And third, our strong results are just a glimpse of Mosaic's future. The earnings growth trajectory is evident and it was a much greater promise for our shareholders in the years to come."", 'For the quarter, Mosaic earned $391 million on net sales of $2.5 billion compared with earnings of $248 million on sales of $2.4 billion a year ago. The earnings improvement were driven by a higher conflict sales volumes and higher realized potash prices, in addition to lower operating costs. We earned $1.08 per share; that number benefited from the lower share count resulting from aggressive repurchase activity.', 'Importantly, we continue to deliver strong operating cash flow with $583 million generated in the second quarter. I would like to point that our earnings per share for this second quarter, net of disclosed items, were higher than our earnings per share for the second quarter of 2013, which ended before the breakup of the BPC marketing organization. Potash prices are about $100 per ton lower than they were then, and grain and oilseed prices as well, as grower economics are weaker today.', ""That's a stark indication of our progress and of our ability to thrive across market cycles. How did we accomplish these improvements? I won't recount all the actions we've taken, but suffice it to say, we made timely, valuable acquisitions and we integrated them seamlessly. We optimized our portfolio by selling or exiting less profitable businesses, which significantly improved our cost structure. We've made good progress on our goal to generate cost savings of $500 million from both operating units and the corporate functions. And we returned meaningful capital to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. I know that Mosaic will not rest on these laurels, but I will leave it to Joc to talk about the future."", 'Business conditions overall improved during the quarter, but markets have diverged in different regions of the world. In North America, where farmers defied Wall Street expectations and planted enough acreage to deliver another very large crop, overly abundant rain in the Eastern corn belt damaged corps and led to swings in grain and oilseed prices. These recent swings have not changed our expectations for strong second half fertilizer sales.', 'The spring fertilizer application season in North America played out as we expected it would. Farmers who planted crops fertilized them to maximize yield. However, high beginning channel inventories led to lower sales in North America in the first half. The lone soft spot among our major markets was Brazil, where economic issues delayed fertilizer demand. The volatile real, the weak overall economy, and a temporary freeze on farm credit led to paralysis. Now, with better credit availability and stable grain prices enticing farmers, demand is slowly emerging, which bodes well for our second half of the year.', 'In India, the strong demand we expected has developed. Second quarter DAP imports were up 178% to 2.6 million tonnes. We increased our expectations and now anticipate that India will import 5.5 to 6 million tonnes of phosphate and 4.5 to 5 million tonnes of potash this year, up significantly over 2014. Indian farmers are enjoying a relatively strong year with ample monsoon rains and good growing conditions in most areas of the country.', 'Chinese potash demand has also met our expectations and Canpotex is shipping against its record 1.8 million tonne contract.', ""Overall, this was a good quarter for Mosaic and for the agricultural markets in most of the world. For quite some time, we have been demonstrating Mosaic's resilience in tough times. And now, we are beginning to see the power of our franchise in better markets."", ""Now, I'll turn the call over to our CFO, Rich Mack, for more insight into the quarter, our capital, and our guidance. Rich?""]",management_discussion,MOS_87853
2508,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thank you, Jim. With this as your last earnings call, on behalf of Mosaic's 9,000 plus employees across the globe, thank you so much for your dedicated leadership and service to Mosaic. We will certainly miss you."", ""Now, turning to business for the quarter, I'll begin today with some detail on our three operating segments. The Phosphates segment continued to generate strong operating results, with high sales volumes and relatively stable prices for both our finished products and raw materials. Market forces are only part of the story in phosphates. Our improved margin rate in the segment was also driven by high operating rates, excellent cost control, and solid day-to-day operating performance."", ""The average DAP selling price during the quarter was $450 per tonne, down from $465 last year. Raw material prices held their first quarter declines, though we do expect market prices for sulfur and ammonia to increase modestly in the second half of the year. We've been expressing that our Phosphates business underappreciated by the market and we're continuing to make notable strides in delivering results in this segment."", 'In the Potash segment, our margins remained strong, despite the lack of price improvement. Our MOP cash cost per tonne remained very attractive, at $89 per tonne, which includes $18 per tonne of brine management expenses. These low costs are driven by running our low cost Canadian mines at higher operating rates, exiting higher cost MOP production in the US, a foreign currency tailwind, and by meaningful, durable cost reductions.', 'In the International Distribution segment, our higher volumes were driven by the ADM acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay, with integration now essentially complete. Lower margins in the segment primarily reflect the impact of declining prices and delayed fertilizer demand in Brazil, partially offset by the impact of the weaker local currency on expenses.', ""Now, I'll move on to our balance sheet and capital. Our balance sheet remained strong, and we are within our targeted leverage ratio range. We have approximately $2.2 billion in cash and cash equivalents at the end of the second quarter, and Mosaic continues to be a very strong generator of cash flow. We expect this to continue as we reap the benefits of our recent growth investments and expense management initiatives. This cash has driven significant returns for our shareholders as you can see on the slide."", 'Our capital allocation philosophy, which is balanced between investments for growth and shareholder distributions, is enhancing our growth and contributing to our increased earnings leverage. Subsequent to quarter-end, we completed our $500 million accelerated share repurchase program. Going forward, we expect to continue normal open market repurchases under the remaining $1 billion in authorization with any activity being reported out during our regular reporting cycle.', ""Now, let's move on to our guidance for the third quarter. In Phosphates, we expect our gross margin rate to remain in the low 20% range. We expect operating rates in Phosphates to be in the mid-80% range. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.1 to 2.4 million tonnes for the third quarter compared with actual sales of 2.2 million tonnes in the third quarter of 2014. DAP prices are expected to be in the range of $435 to $455 per tonne. We now expect full year volumes to be at the upper end of our initial estimate at 9.5 to 10.0 million tonnes."", 'International Distribution sales volumes are expected to be in the range of 1.9 to 2.2 million tonnes with a gross margin of $20 to $26 per tonne. We narrowed full year volume expectations to be in the range of 6.0 to 6.5 million tonnes.', 'In Potash, we anticipate continuing strong global demand. Increased potash affordability is driving increased applications. North American demand is expected to be strong in the second half and we expect Canpotex to ship record tonnes this year. During the third quarter, we intend to produce at reduced rates because of planned turnarounds at our Canadian mines. During this period, we expect to draw down inventories throughout the quarter.', 'We expect operating rates in Potash to be in the mid-60% range and sales volumes to be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 million tonnes during the third quarter, compared with actual sales of 1.8 million tonnes in the same period of 2014.', 'With the slower start to the first half of 2015, we now expect full year Potash volumes to range from 8.2 to 8.6 million tonnes. Average realized prices are expected to be in the range of $260 to $280 per tonne with the gross margin rate to be in the low 20% range. Both the operating rate and the gross margin rate are in line with last year, as a result of the lower production rates in the seasonally slower third quarter. Our expectation for full-year SG&A costs also remains unchanged at $360 million to $380 million. We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives across the company, and we are ahead of schedule as we work towards our goal of achieving $500 million in savings by 2018.', ""Our estimate for Canadian resource taxes and royalties has been lowered to $310 million to $350 million in part as a result of a higher expected mix of lower priced standard product. We've also lowered the top-end of our capital expenditure and investment guidance for 2015 with such guidance now being between $1.1 billion and $1.3 billion. All other guidance ranges remain unchanged."", 'I should note that projected capital costs for our Saudi Arabian joint venture have been revised, and are now estimated to be about $8 billion, which is about $500 million more than the initial estimates. Keep in mind this is a project finance deal, so our incremental cash equity contributions will be less than $40 million. Nevertheless, the project remains strategic and financially compelling to Mosaic. We considered the potential for costs overruns when we assessed the project and were comfortable with the expected returns even with this higher capital cost.', ""As a reminder, we expect the ammonia plant to begin operating in mid-2016, which will support construction cash flow needs. The Wa'ad Al-Shamal phosphate complex as a whole, is expected to be the lowest cost facility in the world, and our investment is expected to generate attractive returns above a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. As you can see from the photos, this is a megaproject and a tremendous amount of work is advancing in the kingdom. We will continue to update the market as the work progresses."", 'So, to close my comments, I would summarize by stating that Mosaic is making measureable progress in our efficiency and operating performance. We are seeing bottom-line benefits and we expect further strength in the second half of this year and beyond. We continue to monitor North American crop development, Brazilian fertilizer demand and Chinese phosphate exports as the major uncertainties in the second half of 2015.', 'With that, I will turn the call over to Joc for his comments on the remainder of the year.']",management_discussion,MOS_87853
2509,James O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Rich. Before I discuss the outlook, I would like to acknowledge Jim's remarkable leadership over the past decade. I am entering my tenure as CEO with an excellent foundation and an extremely promising future for Mosaic, and Jim deserves a great deal of credit for that."", ""Now, on to our view of the future. Our outlook for the reminder of the year remains positive with good demand from the big four agricultural regions. I'll go through them one at a time. In North America, the extreme wet conditions in the Eastern corn belt have reminded us once again that agriculture is unpredictable. At the start of the season, it look like it might be another record crop. But expectations declined and then recently rebounded again. Despite these swings, today, our products remain affordable and provide good value for farmers. Irrespective of near-time market volatility and swings in sentiment, at Mosaic, we manage for success across the whole cycle and for leverage in good times. The secular trend remains undeniably positive."", 'In China, demand is underpinned by high crop prices with nearby corn and wheat futures trading at approximately $10 $12 per bushel, respectively. MOP shipments climbed to a record last year and are expected to be higher in 2015. Demand is accelerating.', 'Phosphates are a different story in China. We expect Chinese exports to be in the 8.5 to 9 million tonne range this year, which is higher than our previous estimate. Global supply and demand is likely to remain balanced, however, due to multiple production challenges in other parts of the world. Our most recent demand forecast is around 65.5 million tonnes. Stable stripping margins in the first half of 2015 offer a good proof point of balanced supply and demand. We will continue to watch closely both the level of exports as well as the broader GDP growth in China.', ""Elsewhere in Asia, India has been a bright spot. Our expectation for 2015 shipments continues to increase. In addition to second quarter DAP imports at levels more than double last year, industry potash sales in India are up almost 10% in the first half of 2015. This is despite uncertainty about the government subsidy until just a few weeks ago. The Indian government's new budget included few changes for agriculture as expected, but it did provide more certainty for farmers. As a result, we expect continued strong demand in India through the second half of the year with the monsoon season and the rupee on our closely watched list."", ""Jim described the economic challenges in Brazil. While the country's economy and currency remain volatile, fertilizer demand is emerging with the improving availability of credit and stable global grain prices. Soybean prices in reals are very attractive. And if they are going to plant in Brazil, farmers have to fertilize. Imports in Brazil have been lower than last year, but the new demand is helping Brazil catch up with expectations; that in turn, bodes well for the second half of the year. And as we've done in the past, we continue to play a market leader role, leveraging our global presence and allocating tonnes to maximize value. Most recently, we moved tonnes to North America when Brazil demand was delayed."", 'So, dynamics are quite different from region to region. Overall, demand for our products is strong and we expect good demand for the remainder of 2015.', ""At Mosaic, we are focused on the things we can control and we feel great about our progress. We're generating significant value from our long list of strategic initiatives. We're positioning Mosaic on the left-hand side of the global cost curves. We've integrated our acquisitions well and we've returned substantial capital to our shareholders. We have developed a highly resilient model for softer parts of the business cycle and we are beginning to demonstrate substantial earnings leverage in good markets.

There is still the headwinds on credit; there still is the volatility that's happening with the currency. But through it all, it's a very strong agricultural environment.

2591,James Prokopanko,"['Good morning. Welcome to our first quarter earnings discussion.', 'Our results this quarter clearly demonstrate progress on our strategic priorities. Compared to last year, the timely acquisition of CF Industries’ phosphates business added $0.06 to our quarterly earnings per share. Expense initiatives and asset optimization drove lower potash cost per tonne, adding $0.07 per share in the quarter, despite a negative $0.15 per share impact of the change in Canadian resource taxes and royalties.', 'Finally, repurchases of 62 million shares added another $0.07 in EPS this quarter. And this is just the beginning of the benefit we will generate from those moves. Nothing about our bullish long-term outlook for Mosaic’s future has changed since our Analyst Day, so we won’t repeat the full story on today’s call. Instead our prepared comments will be brief, with a focus on the market conditions we expect for the second quarter and second-half of 2015.', 'I’ll begin with a review of our solid first-quarter results which were well ahead of last year. Then Rich Mack will discuss segment results, our capital position, and our guidance. And finally, I’ll conclude with a view of the evolving global phosphate and potash market dynamics.', 'Our message to you today is simple, Mosaic is delivering solid performance and we expect 2015 to be a good year. For the quarter, Mosaic generated $295 million in net earnings or $0.80 per share, almost a 50% increase over the weaker first quarter of 2014. Our adjusted earnings were $0.70 per share, with foreign currency transaction gains accounting for most of the difference. I want to emphasize that we continue to generate significant cash with $656 million in cash flow from operations during the first quarter.', 'Our results were within our guidance ranges, say for the phosphate operating rate, which missed the low end of the range by 1 percentage point as a result of an accelerated plant turnaround.', 'In potash, volumes came in at low-end of our expectations primarily due to lower North American shipments. The late arriving spring compounded by increased imports sitting in the Gulf of Mexico has impacted demand and pricing in much of North America. The new potash contract with China not only provided price transparency for customers elsewhere in the world. The volumes also demonstrated the pent-up demand, we’ve been anticipating.', 'If our expectations for the second-half of 2015 hold, our challenge will be to produce enough tonnes to deliver contracted volumes. Historically, timing of North America demand and shipments during this time of year is uncertain. This year delayed North American crop progress and changes in dealer inventories make it even harder to predict, but the uncertainty is around shipments, not necessarily actual application rates.', 'Spring arrives and farmers plant their crop, this year is no different. In fact, we’ve increased our estimates for global potash shipments to the high-end of our previous range. We now estimate 2015 global potash shipments to be in the 59 million tonne to 60 million tonne range.', 'Potash elasticity of demand appears higher than we previously believed, and we may continue to see strong demand growth if prices of our products remain as affordable as they are now. We continue to expect a good second-half of 2015, though our medium-term outlooks still needs to the informed by U.S. crop developments, grain and oilseed prices.', 'With that, I will turn the call over to Rich. And then, I’ll conclude with our views of the diverging markets around the world.']",management_discussion,MOS_82947
2592,Richard Mack,"['Thank you, Jim, and good morning to everyone. I’ll begin today with some detail on our three operating segments. In the phosphate segment, the primary contributor of our improving profitability is higher selling prices for our products, with the average DAP price $45 higher than a year ago, as well as volumes from the CF phosphate acquisition. In addition, we also continue to capture stronger margins from our premium MicroEssentials product.', 'Raw material prices were higher this quarter compared to a year-ago, but the sequential quarter trend was in our favor. Sulfur prices have declined over $30 per tonne in recent months, and we believe the falling market prices for urea foretell lower ammonia prices going forward. All told, the cost of sulfur and ammonia in one tonne of DAP has dropped about $45 since last November. We believe that Mosaic’s leadership position and our previous decision to operate at lower rates contributed to these trends.', 'In the potash segment, our strong margins and significantly improved year-over-year earnings were driven primarily by our operating efficiency. Our cost reduction efforts including our decision to stop MOP production at Carlsbad, and decommission and sell the Hersey mine are delivering meaningful value to the bottom line, and importantly shifting us to the left on the global cost curve. In fact, first quarter MOP cash cost per tonne were $86 including $17 of brine management expenses. This is a $5 per tonne improvement over our impressive fourth quarter numbers. These costs are significantly better than what you saw for Mosaic in prior years.', 'This is the first full quarter with ADM’s fertilizer business under our belt, with integration progressing as planned. In the International Distribution segment our $21 per tonne gross margin came in slightly under our expectations because of higher prices for raw materials that were passed through to us from ADM. We have now fully integrated the newly acquired business into our ERP system and expect to have better visibility into our costs going forward. Volumes for International Distribution were higher than expected, and we believe sales volumes and margins will improve through the remainder of 2015.', 'Moving onto our balance sheet and capital, as Jim noted earlier, we provided substantial insight on our capital plans at our Analyst Day at the end of March, so I won’t go through all that detail again today. I would however like to mention a few key points.', 'First, our balance sheet remains strong and we are within our stated targeted leverage ratio range. We have approximately $2.5 billion in cash and cash equivalents, and currently have approximately $700 million of excess cash. As you know Mosaic has been a very strong generator of free cash flow and we expect that to continue as we reap the benefits of our recent growth investments.', 'In the first quarter, we distributed $215 million to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. At current prices for Mosaic stock we plan to continue to work down the existing share repurchase authorization. As we noted at our Analyst Day we will discuss additional repurchase authority with our board as we reach the end of our current authorization.', 'To reiterate our stance on shareholder returns, we have been an active distributor of excess cash to shareholders and are committed to returning excess capital to shareholders in the future. We expect to generate ample free cash flow that will fund future shareholder distributions.', 'Now, let’s move on to our guidance for the second quarter. Note, that we have slightly widened our volume guidance ranges given the uncertainty Jim mentioned earlier. In phosphates, we expect gross margins to be around 20%, primarily as a result of lower raw material costs. We expect operating rates in phosphates to be in the range of 80% to 85%. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.3 million to 2.7 million tonnes for the second quarter compared with actual sales of 2.6 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2014. DAP prices are expected to be in the range of $425 to $450 per tonne.', 'International Distribution sales volumes are expected to be in the range of 1.4 million tonnes to 1.7 million tonnes with a gross margin of $18 to $25 per tonne. This wider range of gross margin reflects the current volatility of the Brazilian real. We ended the first quarter with an exchange rate of BRL 3.2 to the dollar, and touched BRL 2.9 just this week. Our full-year volume expectations are unchanged.', 'In potash we anticipate that our mines will continue to operate at high rates to meet global demand, with operating rates expected to be in the 85% to 90% range. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.0 million to 2.4 million tonnes during the quarter, compared with actual sales of 2.5 million tonnes in the second quarter of 2014.', 'We remain committed to our full-year volume forecast. Average realized potash prices are expected to be in the range of $265 to $290 per tonne, with a gross margin rate in the upper 30% range. We raised Canadian resource tax guidance as a result of both the new tax rules in Saskatchewan and higher expected Canadian dollar gross margins, due primarily to the recent Canadian dollar devaluation. We now expect Canadian resource taxes and royalties to be in the range of $325 million to $375 million for 2015.', 'Our guidance for full-year brine management expenses remains that $180 million to $200 million. Our expectation for full-year SG&A costs also remains unchanged at $360 million to $380 million. We continue to make good progress on our cost savings initiatives across the company and we are ahead of schedule as we work toward our goal of achieving $500 million in savings by 2018.', 'Our tax rate guidance has changed for 2015 we now expect the full-year effect of tax rate to be in the high teens excluding discrete items. The offsetting impact of the higher Canadian resource taxes on Canadian federal income taxes combined with other items related to our global footprint in business mix is the primary driver of a lower tax liability this year. In 2016, the effective tax rate is expected to return to the low 20% range. The other elements of our guidance, capital expenditures and annual sales volumes for phosphates, potash, and international distribution are unchanged from last quarter. Specifically, we expect robust second-half shipments given the delayed shipments to India, China, and Brazil.', 'So in short, Mosaic is making measurable progress in our efficiency and operating performance. We continue to be focused on our cost reduction initiatives and look forward to a strong 2015.', 'With that, I will turn the call back to Jim.']",management_discussion,MOS_82947
2593,James Prokopanko,"['Thank you, Rich. Before we take your questions, I would like to provide some insight into the current and near-term market dynamics for potash and phosphates. While we have seen a slower start this year in some regions, our 2015 global demand expectations for both potash and phosphates are unchanged. Our products remain affordable and provide good value for farmers.', 'Friends in different regions of the world are diverging. So let’s take a quick turnaround the globe. In North America spring planting got off to a late start in the South, but farmers are quickly making progress. With the season just entering full swing, we’ve heard anecdotal reports about cutbacks in applications rates. But we asked feedback from our largest customers indicate that their P&K sales are in line with levels over the last few years and most of the farmer customers are applying P&K at normal or near normal rates.', 'North American shipments in the first-half of 2015 are expected to be below average. But that is mainly due to higher beginning levels of the dealer inventories. Given the uncertainties about the crop prices, we expect North American distributors will clean out channel inventories this spring and begin to refill bins for fall application only when the outlook becomes a bit clearer.', 'That, however, maybe about the same time as peak second-half shipments to Brazil and India, which could make a challenging for producers to meet strong demand in the second-half of 2015. In China, demand is underpinned by high crop prices with nearby corn and wheat futures trading at more than $10 and $11 per bushel. Implied MOP shipments climbed to a record last year and are expected to be higher in 2015. It appears that at the current price, demand is accelerating.', 'The new Canpotex potash contract is a clear indicator of strong demand, with minimum volume commitments significantly above last year’s levels. This volume also reflects our new multiple customer approach in China. While some market observers were disappointed with the contract price, we are satisfied with the netbacks we are receiving from China.', 'More tonnes sold at respectable netbacks is good news for Mosaic and its investors. We are off to a good start this year in India. Industry potash sales in India are up almost 20% in the first quarter of 2015 despite uncertainty about the government subsidy. This uncertainty will remain until the Indian government publishes its final budget. The rupee has been fairly stable and current phosphate and potash prices continue to make complicated import economics work for importers.', 'Retailer’s phosphate and potash inventories are at extremely low levels in India, and more imports are needed to restock. In fact, we have sold over 200,000 tonnes of phosphates to India during the delayed North American spring application season, tactical move to balance different market dynamics. This is yet another example of a market leadership role in phosphates. In potash early indications lead us to believe a Canpotex contract will be signed before June.', 'Also, while we are not counting on an imminent change in the nutrient subsidy system, lower energy prices are clearly providing a tailwind to the Indian budget. As we mentioned at our Analyst Day, we are optimistic about demand growth in India. In the first quarter, Brazil imports were lower than last year, as a result of inventory destocking and currency volatility driving gross to wait to purchase fertilizer until the last minute. We do not see it as an indicator of a decline in demand. Most resilient soil requires potash and phosphates, so if farmers plant they must fertilize.', 'While on the first quarter of this year, imports of P&K were down 37%. Between now and the rest of the year, we expect Brazil import 11.5 million tonnes of potash and phosphate. The agriculture situation continues to look promising in Brazil, with farmers and sell their products in U.S. dollar-denominated transactions actually benefiting from the weakened real. The market dynamics are quite different from region to region.', 'Overall, demand for our products from growers is strong. Changes in pipeline and producer inventories certainly don’t always make this fact obvious in the short-term. Mosaic’s boots on the ground presence all these critical markets gives us a competitive advantage. We have firsthand knowledge of in-country market dynamics and the ability to adapt quickly to meet shifting customer needs. We are closely watching the 2015 crop progress and the implications for grain and oilseed pricing, which will influence second-half 2015 and 2016 demand expectations.', 'With that said a bullish second-half scenario is likely. We wouldn’t be surprised to see an earlier summer fill in North America. Brazil is likely to import more tonnes of P&K in the second-half of 2015 than in 2014. China is expected to import about million tonnes more of potash this year on top of very strong volume growth last year, and India’s appetite for phosphates is ahead of our expectations.', 'We feel very positive about Mosaic’s ability to succeed in the current environment and across the business cycle. Our investments for growth are generating strong incremental value. We have secured global market access and a significant advantage in North America, and we are demonstrating that Mosaic can and will be one of the lowest cost operators in the industry. In short, we have put Mosaic on a path to growing prosperity and that bodes well for our stakeholders.', 'Now, we will be happy to take your questions.']",management_discussion,MOS_82947

Yes, this year the imports from non-Canadian potash of non-Canadian potash has been higher than we’ve seen in past years. And what the Eastern Europeans are figuring out is that North America is a higher netback market. So we’re seeing those tonnes come to North America, but an important thing to remember is those tonnes that are coming to North America are not going to Brazil, India, and China. So there’s a net balance and we’ll see, if not shortages, tighter supplies going to other parts of the world.', 'I’m going to have Mike Rahm speak to you about the volumes and what kind of increase we’re seeing from whether it’s the Belarusians or Uralkali and then I may just wrap up with the comments about the issues on the allowance of those products to come into the country.

2601,James Prokopanko,"['Yes, good day, Andrew. It’s a good question. I’m glad you made that observation. We have along with expense reduction initiatives in both SG&A and our phosphate business which are showing results. We’re seeing very good and probably ahead of planned results on our potash. I’m going to turn it over to Joc O’Rourke, our operations leader to speak to that. But this has been something we’ve applied our efforts to over the last 12 months, seeing good results.', 'What we’re doing simply is stabilizing our production levels. We’ve always maintained a capacity to produce at higher rates than what experience has for demand - has been for the demand. And now we’ve said, look, we’re not going to build a church for Easter Sunday; we’re going to have a preset production level. We may have more capacity but we’re going to staff and man to a level that is going to be more predictable and that is going to result in lower costs.', 'And so the result is we might not be there to take advantage of a sudden fly up but we are going to be running our facilities at lower predictable rates. Now, I’m going to have Joc just speak to some of the specific things we’ve done to reduce potash production costs.']",question_answer,MOS_82947
2602,James O’Rourke,"['So, Andrew, I think Jim has probably summarized it quite well. Of course, there is a little bit of Canadian dollar tailwind, but the big thing was, first of all, the asset optimization. So shutting down Hersey or selling Hersey and shutting down the potash at Carlsbad was the first big step. Those were our two highest cost producers. We felt we could deliver cheaper from Canada than we could run those plants. So we’ve now done that.', 'The next piece was as Jim said, was kind of rightsizing the operations. So we had a lot of people to allow for those run-ups, and we’ve now made sure we optimize that. And then finally, a lot of work on just reducing waste, whether that be the number of miners we have running underground or the amount of stuff we have going on around our plant.

It will depend a lot on where crop prices go; how many acres of corn and soybeans get planted and so forth.

2614,James Prokopanko,"['Hey, Joel, you’re good at getting a couple of questions in and welcome to the call. The first question about the demand, I and Joc commented we are running our facility - our potash operations at ratable capacity and we took couple of our high-cost facilities out. We are running the Canadian facilities at optimal rates in terms of expenses and we continue and plan to continue to do so. In this first-half, we’ve seen following 2014, where the pipeline was fairly well filled with potash. We are now drawing that potash down.', 'And I think I made it clear in my comments, with a strong second-half to refill and to meet the growing demand we’re seeing in India and China, we think we’re going to go into a tight potash market in the second-half. And there could be some constraints in terms of supply relative to what we anticipate to be higher demand. So absolutely, the market is going to tighten up and with that we are - with a tighter market you could potentially see a higher - and we expect to see higher potash prices.', 'On the second question about Belarusian, yes, we’re absolutely a believer in free trade. We don’t begrudge anyone that. We believe for the ag markets to work, we have to have free and open trade. So getting into the nuances that go with geopolitics on who’s allowed to come into what countries, we’re standing aside on that for this matter in belief of free trade.', 'And as I said earlier, if Belarusian or Russian products, additional product comes into North America, that is product that is not going into India, China or Brazil, and we’ll see the market. The balance won’t change and there will be some tightening of supply going into some of these other markets. So we’re - push here, it pops out there, so were not too exercised about the Belarusian product, not at all. And our estimate is, there are only about three vessels of Belarusian product who came here. And if we have a customer in North America that wants to buy a Eastern European potash, Chinese phosphate, there’s Iranian nitrogen, well that’s trifector [ph] of unsecured supplier.

They’ve got very low inventories from all the reports we hear from the industry and from our people in the country. So they’ve got to get shipping product to their ports soon.', 'From Vancouver, it’s just over 30, it’s about 35-day shipping from Vancouver to the Indian ports then you’ve got to get it in country at another 10 days if it moves promptly. So we’re talking about 40 days a month and a half away to have it there in time of July. So if you needed there in mid-July, let’s say, you’re going to have to have this product on a vessel at the port ready to go before the end of May.', 'So I’m anticipating that the Indians will be booking a contract in the next - sometime early in May, or sometime in May. The price we’ve heard, they are negotiating what’s reported in the trade press with the - Russians are looking for $20 a tonne over last year’s value, we’ll see what it - what the final realization is. But I think the China deal is a good model and we will see India book shortly. Rick?']",question_answer,MOS_82947
2624,Richard McLellan,"['Yes, good morning, Don. I’ll talk about the two things. In Brazil, we’ve seen prices since the Chinese contract stabilized. The issue in Brazil is still about farmer demand. And farmer demand is being impacted by volatility in the currency, longer-term, mid-term, lower or weaker Brazilian real is good for agriculture. And so I think we’ve talked earlier about our expectation of a very strong second-half. And so if you think about what the drivers will be in Brazil, there is only so much logistics capacity to get product into the country and through to the farm.', 'And that’s going to be challenged the longer farmer waits. And so with the currency situation, we see them waiting, but we have seen potash prices stabilize. As far as a Somerville discount today, I would say, we’re a little too early to talk about how markets will work out for this summer.

Your question how much do we buy in the quarter? It’s about $125 million of stock we repurchased in the first quarter of 2015. And some of the things that I would share with you just from a color commentary perspective is Mosaic’s strong cash flow generation $650 million in the first quarter, which is very positive, and as you noted, we have about $700 million currently of excess cash.', 'So we have $100 million or $150 million left under our current share repurchase authorization. And we expect that we will exhaust that remaining authorization. As I noted in the Analyst Day events, we will be reviewing the issue of capital, capital management, and additional share authorizations with our board, and we have our Annual Meeting just to note in the mid-May time horizon. So we’ll certainly provide additional updates when we have more information.', 'We agree with you at current prices. Mosaic’s share price is very attractive. I would note that we have been extraordinarily active in the last 14 months. We have repurchased 60 million shares of Mosaic stock. And with respect to our balance sheet targets, I think I indicated in Florida that our mix on our liquidity buffer are 2.5 billion, that is something that we will continue to review. And the mix between cash and revolver capacity is something that could change over time.', 'And with respect to our leverage target, we’re comfortable, but it’s something that we continue to look at.

And then on potash, I know historically, you’ve taken more of cutbacks in the third quarter, but it sounds like now you’re going to be running in a more stable operating rates, so would it be fair to you kind of the past profile we saw in the first quarter and from that through?

2645,James O’Rourke,"['Thanks, Michael. Yes, just let’s hit the phosphate question first. In the next couple of quarters, we’re seeing probably a downward trend on ammonia pricing likely to hit us and probably a flat, when we look at the World Markets, probably a flat sulfur pricing in the next couple of quarters.', 'In terms of timing, the way that hits us is with moving it through the cost of goods sold, it’s probably a lag period of somewhere between one-and-a-half and three months for that really to show up. So there’s always a little bit of a time lag there. What we would see is the more recent ammonia pricing and we really start seeing that about a quarter away. So next quarter, we should start seeing the impact of that.', 'In terms of the potash business, generally our shutdowns, our plant turnarounds are held - done in the summer months because of weather and availability. So we wouldn’t see ourselves running at high operating rates in the months of July, August, and September. Those would traditionally be our lower operating rate months. And so our costs will reflect that in those months.']",question_answer,MOS_82947
2646,Richard Mack,"['I’m going to add to that Michael. Our operating costs and raw material costs are important strategic levers that we have a good bit of control over, not entire control over, but we could influence up those costs. And we’ve been working hard to do that. We had back in 2014, we took some curtailment, because we believe that ammonia and sulfur were getting on the line with the pricing of the finished product. And that had the desired impact. We’ve also made investments in a sulfur melter that will be operational towards the end of this year. And that is going to give us some optionality in sourcing sulfur from nontraditional North American markets.', 'We have the anhydrous ammonia supply agreement with CF industries that’s going to give us a preferred pricing on ammonia. And we’re also looking at debottlenecking our Louisiana ammonia facility again to provide us with some lower-cost ammonia. So you’re right onto ask that question to follow that component, it’s so important in phosphates that would really is the principal financial item to look at is the stripping margin or the gross margin not so much the price when we run that business.

2651,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Good morning to you all. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter earnings meeting. A year ago, on our fourth quarter 2013 earnings call, I said the following: We're starting to see some rays of sunlight at the end of this tunnel, and Mosaic is well positioned for the daylight to come. Well, our predictions don't always come true, but in this case, it's very gratifying to be proven right. The sunlight was real and Mosaic was, and is, in excellent position to benefit in better parts of the business cycle."", ""Given that we updated our earnings expectations in mid-January, we realized our results don't come as a surprise. So today, we will focus on the drivers behind our strong finish to the year and we'll discuss our outlook for 2015."", ""Our key messages for today are: First, our earnings are beginning to reflect the leverage we've built into the business through our many strategic moves. I want to emphasize that we outperformed expectations without significant appreciation in prices for our products or in the prices of grains and oilseeds."", 'Second, robust demand for our products and good execution were the primary drivers of our earnings, and we expect global demand to remain strong in 2015.', 'And third, we are successfully executing our strategic initiatives and many of them are now fully operationalized.', ""For the quarter, Mosaic earned $361 million or $0.97 per share, including a positive impact of $0.10 per share of notable items, an increase of roughly threefold from a year ago. Our revenues for the quarter were $2.4 billion, up 9% over the fourth quarter of 2013. Both of Mosaic's business segments outperformed our expectations."", 'In Phosphates, our volumes exceeded the top of our initial guidance range by 450,000 tonnes as customers sought to position inventory in anticipation of a strong spring application season. The Phosphates segment generated $286 million in gross margin and improved its gross margin rate to 18.2% during the quarter.', 'The Potash segment exceeded our gross margin guidance by several percentage points as cost per tonne dropped and we operated at very high operating rates, mostly because of a highly successful Canpotex proving run at Colonsay.', 'We also continued to generate strong operating cash flow of $382 million during the quarter, bringing our full year cash flow from operations to $2.3 billion, an almost $300 million improvement over 2013. We are putting our cash to use by continuing to invest in the business, both organically and strategically, and repurchasing our shares. And we ended the quarter with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents.', 'For the full year of 2014, we delivered good results despite the choppy market conditions throughout the year. Mosaic earned $1 billion on revenues of $9.1 billion, both essentially flat when compared with 2013, but with significantly more positive trends exiting the year. We have built a business model that is both resilient to challenging market conditions and positioned to accelerate quickly as conditions improve. Our results for the quarter and the year corroborate both of these concepts.', 'Market conditions stabilized in the fourth quarter, but grain and oilseed prices remained relatively low. Demand for our products, on the other hand, was extremely strong. Our fourth quarter is typically a seasonally slow period for us, but our customers came to the market in force. We met the demand with excellent operational performance.', 'Our potash mines ran at 91% of capacity, higher than expected because of the strong demand and the Colonsay proving run I mentioned earlier. Going into the quarter, producer inventories were very low and despite running all out, we shipped rather than stored the vast majority of the potash tonnes we produced.', 'The phosphate story has also been good. Global demand for phosphates has been strong for some time, and the trend continued in the fourth quarter. In November, we announced and executed a phosphate production curtailment in response to high raw material costs. Ammonia prices softened and customers stepped in to purchase our products, and as a result, we were able to exit the fourth quarter without building high-cost inventory for the spring season. This is a good illustration of our market leadership in phosphates.', ""I'd now like to highlight some of the other progress we made during the quarter and the year. As I mentioned, we completed a successful Canpotex proving run at Colonsay, significantly exceeding targeted production. As a result, our peaking capacity increased by 700,000 tonnes, and our Canpotex entitlement is now 40.6% effective January 2015."", 'In total, our proving runs for Esterhazy and Colonsay added 1.7 million tonnes compared to the expected increase of 1.3 million tonnes, almost 30% higher. These exceptional results were delivered on budget and on time.', 'The CF acquisition and integration are, for all intents and purposes, complete, and we are generating better-than-expected financial and operational synergies from the additional facilities.', 'The ADM distribution acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay closed near the end of the year, and integration work is proceeding well. We are now a major player in South America with the capacity to distribute 6 million tonnes of product.', ""We continue to be on track for the first phase of our Esterhazy K3 project, which is expected to begin delivering tonnes in 2017. The board has approved the modification of the original scope to accelerate the second phase of K3 development. The accelerated construction plan will move up the time frame when we could execute the option to replace underground mining operations at K1 and K2 and, thus, entirely eliminate brine management costs. We'll discuss the Esterhazy expansion and the options it gives us in more detail at our Analyst Day next month."", ""We completed the divestitures of our Southern Cone operations, sold our Hersey mine and discontinued higher-cost MOP production at our Carlsbad mine. Those facilities were not meeting our return expectations and those moves are behind us. We're significantly ahead of plan in our expense savings initiatives with identified savings of $500 million to be realized over a 5-year period."", 'Rich Mack, our CFO, will cover the capital and balance sheet work we accomplished this year in more detail, but I would like to note that we reached our debt leverage target while returning more than $3.1 billion to shareholders.', ""And last but not least, the Ma'aden project continues to rise from the desert, and we've included a couple of recent photos of the facility in our slide presentation today."", ""2014 was a busy year for Mosaic, but we are not resting. As we move into this year, we're proceeding with the evaluation of a de-bottlenecking project at our Faustina, Louisiana, ammonia plant. Our MicroEssentials conversion at New Wales is well underway, and we are also building a sulfur smelter at our New Wales, Florida, plant in close proximity to other chemical plants so that we will be more self-sufficient in phosphate, raw material sourcing."", ""We believe the investments we're making will allow us to maintain our advantage as a low-cost producer. We accomplished all this work and all the normal course of business work while once again improving our safety performance. We set records in our key safety measures for the third consecutive year, which is a real source of pride for the Mosaic team."", ""This long list of accomplishments distinguishes Mosaic by our ability to execute on projects that will benefit our shareholders.

To continue Jim's message, a quarter ago, we suggested that the weak market sentiment that was then pervasive across agriculture was overblown. The results we reported today demonstrate that markets are much more stable than some might think and that we can generate a lot of cash even when commodity markets are not moving upward."", 'This morning, I will provide a bit more color on our segment results, give some insight on our capital plan now that many of our strategic initiatives have been completed and lay out our new guidance for 2015.', 'In the Phosphates segment, our disciplined paid off. After curtailing some phosphate production during the fourth quarter, raw material cost declined and dealers stepped in. We avoided building high-cost inventory, which was the main objective of the curtailment, especially when we saw ammonia and sulfur prices moving opposite of ag commodity prices. Our margins in this segment were higher than expected as a result of both lower mine rock costs and a $10 million pricing adjustment on purchased rock from Miski Mayo which is not expected to recur in the first quarter.', 'In the Potash segment, margins improved dramatically due to our high operating rates and our aggressive cost reduction program. We delivered record production and delivered near-record-low MOP cash costs of $91 per tonne, which includes brine management expenses of $17 per tonne.', ""I'd like to reinforce Jim's message regarding our potash expansions. They are proceeding very well. We have successfully executed Canpotex proving runs at Colonsay and Esterhazy K2, and the massive K3 project remains on schedule and on budget. These expansions are good examples of our prudent capital stewardship, which is underpinned by rigorous planning and solid execution. Like our other major investments, the potash projects have outperformed our initial expectations."", 'Transitioning to capital as we move into 2015. Our overall philosophy on capital management has not changed in any meaningful way. Our priorities, in order, are: to maintain our assets as well as our dividend policy; to invest in growth on organic projects and strategic opportunities that have attractive risk-adjusted returns; and finally, to return cash in excess of our stated liquidity buffer to shareholders.', ""I am happy to say that we delivered on all 4 fronts in 2014, which we believe is a distinguishing characteristic for Mosaic. The transformation of Mosaic's balance sheet in the past 13 months has been remarkable, and I would especially highlight our shareholder distributions. Since our restrictions on share repurchases expired in November 2013, we have repurchased $2.8 billion of stock. In the fourth quarter, we repurchased $259 million of common stock, a clear sign that we find our stock to be a compelling buying opportunity right now. Of course, we also maintained our $1-per-share annual dividend. We are committed to maintaining our balance sheet targets, and our excess cash balance is estimated to be around $500 million once we complete our current share repurchase authorization."", ""While 2014 was a very active year, we will continue to execute against this philosophy in 2015 and beyond, and I'll have more information and updates on our capital plans at our Analyst Day next month."", ""Before I move on to guidance, let me provide an update on our upcoming segment reporting changes. With the acquisition of ADM's distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay, we intend to manage and report a new international distribution segment. Beginning with the first quarter of 2015, we will report 4 segments: Phosphates, Potash, International Distribution and Corporate, with the Phosphates segment splitting out manufacturing from international distribution and a separate Corporate segment containing our legacy Argentinian and Chilean businesses, as well as mark-to-market adjustments on derivatives. The objective of creating a new segment is to increase transparency and improve peer benchmarking and business modeling. Note that we plan to make historical financials available in early March and we will provide additional guidance at that time."", ""Now let's move onto our guidance for the first quarter and 2015 under our current reporting structure. In Phosphates, we expect margins to be in the mid-teens as a result of higher expected realized phosphate rock costs, with operating rates expected to be in the 80% to 85% range. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.8 million to 3.1 million tonnes for the first quarter. This compares to 2.7 million tonnes in last year's period. We expect to see the full benefit of tonnes shipped to the former ADM distribution business in 2015. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $440 to $465 per tonne during the first quarter."", 'In Potash, we anticipate that our mines will operate at high rates to meet global demand. Our operating rate is expected to be in the range of 85% to 90%. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.0 million to 2.3 million tonnes during the first quarter compared with actual volumes of 2.4 million tonnes in the same period last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $270 to $295 per tonne with a marginally higher mix of standard-grade international shipments and with limited upside given North American shipment constraints and inventory availability.', 'The gross margin rate for the Potash segment is expected to be in the upper 30% range. For the full year, we expect Canadian Resource Taxes and Royalties to be in a range of $215 million to $275 million. Our guidance for full year brine management expenses is $180 million to $200 million.', 'We expect SG&A for the year to be in the range of $360 million to $380 million, which includes the SG&A inherited from our recent acquisitions that will be more than offset by the benefits from our expense reduction initiatives. For the year, we estimate an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, in the low to mid-20% range. Our tax rate for 2014 was higher due to our decision to repatriate cash from Esterhazy, which was used for our investment activity and to return capital to shareholders.', 'We expect capital expenditures and equity investments for 2015 to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.4 billion.', 'And finally, we are adding 2 new data points to our annual guidance. For 2015, we expect annual phosphate sales volumes, including international distribution volumes, to be in the range of 14.5 million to 15 million tonnes and potash sales volumes to range from 8.5 million to 9 million tonnes.', ""At our Analyst Day in late March, we will provide a longer-term outlook for our business, including capital expenditures and investments. The event will be held at Streamsong Resort in Florida and will be webcast. I would encourage you to participate. It's a pretty good place to be, especially at the end of March."", 'With that, I will turn the call back now to Jim for his closing thoughts.']",management_discussion,MOS_78991

All indications point to continuing strength in global demand for potash and phosphates through the North American spring. That is not to say that the outlook for agriculture markets are certain. The conditions that were creating weak sentiment last fall still exist. Two consecutive record global harvests have taken a bite out of grain and oilseed prices, and another record crop in 2015 would probably cause more pain for the world's farmers. As always, weather and commodity cycles will affect agriculture and Mosaic."", ""Nevertheless, we continue to believe that the negative sentiment toward our industry has been overblown because farmers will farm, and when they do, they will nourish their crops, and because those consecutive record crops removed record amounts of nutrients from the soil, nutrients that must be replaced.

2656,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Joel, Jim Prokopanko here. Welcome to the call. I should've said something at the beginning of the call. I'll just do that now. We're doing this -- hosting this call from Phoenix, Arizona. We're attending the TFI winter meeting, so we're in a room that isn't as sound secure as we normally seem -- have been, so you might hear some noise and a little racket in the back, and so we apologize for that. But Joel, 2 questions that you asked. You asked about the China contract and impacts on demand in other markets, and the question about potash. I'll take the first one about the Canpotex contract, and then I'll turn it over to Rich Mack to talk about the timing of the sales. The China contract is -- a lot of people are waiting for it. We're quite patient about it here at Mosaic. We expect something could happen in the first quarter. With respect to China, we don't have a need to get something in the book right now. We're completely booked on shipments for the Q1 quarter. We just don't have any capacity to ship if we wanted to. So there's no rush from our point of view on getting that contract done. People are looking at it as a reference marker, but people are continuing to buy, our product's being shipped into China and we're seeing some signs of rising prices in other Southeast Asian -- or Asian markets. So it's not brought the market to a halt by any means and it'll get all sorted out in due time, and we expect it'll be good volumes and with -- and we're sticking to our guns on the increase that we're looking for with the Chinese. So just stay tuned. Rich, will you talk of the timing of the sale for potash?""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2657,Richard L. Mack,"[""Sure, Jim. Joel, in the fourth quarter, just for a reference point, the North American split for potash sales was 42%; and international was roughly in the low 50%, call it, 53-ish percent range.

2665,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Don, good to hear from you. I'll take that first question, just talk to the -- your question about Vanscoy, and my colleagues will answer your second freight question. Vanscoy, reports that we hear, it's starting. They're working on it, they're starting to bring it up. I'm not sure at what pace they will bring that up, but we're, at this point, not anticipating any kind of disruptions in the marketplace, certainly not in the first half and given the low inventories that producers have in Canada. With that said, North America is a very competitive market. By the second half, we may find that some of the additional Agrium tonnes are not required, but our practice, I'm just speaking for Mosaic, has been to produce to demand. We'll continue to practice that. We do not see material changes coming on in -- with respect to market shares in North America and the market will find an equilibrium. The -- some changes -- and I'll just add that we're seeing some importers attempting to bring product into North America this spring. That has not been disruptive, as far as what we can see. We have one traditional import supplier that's had a flooded mine. I expect the other Eastern European supplier might fill those shoes and -- if they do. So we're seeing it a -- being a very tight North American market. And as I said, production is fully committed in the first quarter and we expect a strong second quarter, so we just don't -- we don't see excess capacity in the potash market.

2667,Michael Rahm,"[""Oh. Don, yes, I think it boils down to the relative strength of supply and demand in terms of how that is split. And right now, it's much like raw material cost in phosphate in terms of who keeps that gain, and it's the relative strength of demand. And the markets right now look positive, and I think that bodes pretty well in terms of what producers can hang onto in terms of both lower raw material cost in the case of phosphate as well as lower freight rates.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991

2671,Richard L. Mack,"[""Thanks, Ben, and a relevant question. The way that we look at it, I think, is in connection with the overall capital management philosophy that we articulated in, for the first time, I think it was May of 2013, and since that time, I think it has served us well. Our current dividend yield is about 2%, which is in line with the S&P. And as you probably remember, we've said that we're going to grow the dividend as our business grows and since that time, of course, we've acquired CF Industries. We just closed on ADM. We've brought a lot of incremental potash capacity online. And so our business is growing. And in the future years ahead of us, we would expect that we would see commensurate growth in our EBITDA. So I think with Mosaic, what you could be thinking about is balance. It's not only dividends, but it's share repurchases. And at the current equity price that we were at during the greater part of 2014, we deployed about $2.8 billion in share repurchases because we felt as though our stock was undervalued, especially an under-appreciation, in my view, of our Phosphates business. And so what I would say is stay tuned.

And joint ventures, we're doing that. And finally, the excess cash that we see, we return to shareholders. I got to reinforce, we've not been chintzy about, I think, the number we gave is, the last couple of years, we returned $3.1 billion in cash to shareholders. So stay tuned.

So we've got short-term stability at about $30 below the China market, let's call it. Longer term, really, it's going to be about the U.S. refineries building up to the summer shipping period. So we'll have better supply once those U.S. refineries are running hard, which should be a moderator to any kind of demand increases.

2684,Michael Rahm,"[""Thanks, Jim, and Jeff, I think the story on phosphate, on one hand, it's a good demand story even absent one of the most important buyers, for all intents and purposes, namely India. And I think going forward, we would fully expect that India is going to be back in the market in a much bigger way this year and in the -- really, for the rest of this decade. But I think the other fact that's not fully appreciated is what's happened on the supply side. If you go down the list of major suppliers and take a look at some of the adjustments that have taken place over the last year or 2, there were some pretty dramatic changes. You can probably calculate 2.5 million to 3 million tonnes of supply that is no longer producing. So in the United States, the PotashCorp's Suwannee River plant has been shut down, about 400,000 tonnes of MAP equivalent there. The Misvos [ph] plant has shut down. Close to 600,000 tonnes there. And even around the globe, for example, the UralChem plant in Voskresensk, Russia, shut down last January because it couldn't negotiate a reasonable rock contract. The Tunisians are producing at half of their rate due to labor unrest, environmental issues. OCP is in a turnaround with many of their plants converting to wet rock as opposed to dry rock. And even in places like Brazil, if you look at their production numbers for the last year, their MAP production was off about 11%, equal to about 140,000 tonnes. Their SSP production down 6%, over 300,000 tonnes. So good demand coupled with the fact that -- there have been some supply issues, and a lot of attention has been placed on, geez, the Chinese export of 8 million tonnes of product last year. The fact is, I think, the market needed that given the demand-and-supply developments.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991

This is a good -- the phosphate is a good market. It's really transformed over the last 5, 6 years. We've seen the structure change. We've seen the alternative suppliers find higher costs. Demand has just been outstanding. We're going to be over -- well over, I think it's 65 million, 66 million tonnes of phosphate production, and it just is one that keeps on going and just hasn't had the spotlight.

How could we be off? And at the time that we looked at -- in that November period, early November, we're looking at the big crop coming off in North America. We saw commodity prices, grain, oilseed, wheat prices, weakening and we expected some lower -- frankly, quite a bit lower corn prices, and we were getting ready for a hard landing. The fact was that demand for grains and oilseeds picked up, the crop wasn't quite as big as we thought and we saw grain and oilseed prices stabilize. With that, it was clear that farmers were going to farm again. And even with lower prices, farmers aren't going to grow a smaller crop, they want to grow -- they need to grow a bigger crop. So we knew they'd be coming to the market. We weren't quite sure when. And when it became clear that grain and oilseed prices weren't going to fall off the table, dealers started coming back, farmers started to play their hand that they were going to buy product again, and here we go again. Rick, do you want to add something?""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2689,Richard N. McLellan,"[""Yes. P.J., we talked in Market Mosaic, and I'll let Mike talk about the thought process there, but we talked about application being down. And we made the point that it -- a lot of it is weather-related, and farmers that were applying and did get the chance to apply, applied at normal rates. And the second piece that changed in December, and it came quite quickly, was the fact that farmers came in to retailers and bought prepaid fertilizer for this spring's application at much higher amounts than last year, so that forced the dealers to step in and buy. It's a real good situation, and you can't confuse shipments versus applications.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2690,Michael Rahm,"[""Yes, Rick, and I'd just add a couple of things. One, I think, weather. We -- the fall application season ended pretty early in November, and that's when we made the assessment that usage on the farm was probably off 20% to 25% from normal. And it was off, as Rick pointed out, not due to cutbacks in application rates necessarily, but simply that farmers couldn't spread as many acres as they wanted to because of weather. One other factor that I think came into play is that while November was a bad month, weather-wise, December turned out to be pretty mild. And I recall talking to several dealers at our ag college in early January that December was a very good month in terms of on-farm application in certain parts of the United States. So there's a pretty good tail onto the end of the season. And then the other factor, in terms of retailers, I think retailers saw that good tail application. And then, at the same time, you'll recall that prices bottomed in November and began to increase throughout December and into January, and then certainly, that provided dealers with some incentive to step up and position some product. And then throw on top of that all of the concerns that people have had about logistics and getting product in place. So people were -- sort of sensed the bottom was in, concerned about logistics, let's fill up, and so retail dealers began to fill at that time.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991

Rainy season, it's tough to fully utilize that road. It's not really disrupting our efforts. We are working at -- we brought a vessel in to the Amazon and tried that out. So that road's going to get built. Logistics are a challenge in Brazil. You're absolutely right. That's where it was so important for us to make this investment with the ADM distribution business. It gives us additional port access, allows us the time with the additional warehouse capacity and space in-country in Mato Grosso and the northern states -- northern locations in the soybean-growing area. It gives us the opportunity to get product much closer to the producer than we previously had. The other part is just to comment about this season. Farmers are coming to the market a little later. We've had some economic issues in Brazil, the country has. The real's devalued, which in the end means soybean farmers are going to get more cash, more U.S. dollars for their soybeans. So farmers are just being, as in North America, a little more cautious. But that doesn't mean that they're not going to buy in style.

Not -- nothing near what the Chinese need to China.

2708,Michael Rahm,"[""Sure. With respect to India -- and Yonah, good to talk with you again. I think there are several factors that make us think the stars and moons are lining up in India for very strong import demand. If you start at the farm, farm economics in India remain very good, given some of the increases and their minimum support prices, given the fact that subsidies are in place for fertilizer. We believe that the pipeline in India is at extremely low levels and there's a real need to replenish that. And when I talk about the pipeline, I'm referring primarily to the retail pipeline, the tens of thousands of shops that have a few bags of fertilizer in the back storage room. We think that's where the pipeline is pretty much bare. And then, a couple of other factors. The rupee has performed reasonably well given the chaos that's taken place in the rest of the world. And then, finally, I think if India's going to make any change in subsidy programs, this is a year where there is some potential for that. And when you look at the fact that oil prices have dropped in half and oil is the largest import in India, it gives them a few more degrees of freedom, I think, to modify their subsidy. So I think the bottom line is India needs P&K imports. Stars and moons are lined up. And we think, as the government is deliberating the 2015, '16 budget, that they will make import economics work simply because the product is needed. And then when we look out longer term, I think India, as everyone knows, they're simply -- have a tremendous nutrient imbalance. They need to use a lot for phosphate and potash over time. And we're of the view that Indian phosphate imports could double between now and the end of this decade, and they would still be just slightly above peak imports of 2010. So we're sort of banking on India in many ways, and we think that this is the year that India comes through.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991

Or maybe it'll come down as your EBITDA grows? And then, my second question would just be on the phosphate side of things. We've seen a few acquisitions, you have the Ma'aden project coming online.

2713,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Andrew, I'll take your question -- it's Jim here. I'll take your question about the phosphate and the degree to which we're satisfied with our current footprint. This is a market that we continue to be positive about. We're -- the market, as I said earlier, has changed. The structure of the industry has changed for the better and the barriers to entry are huge. We -- and so we feel very good about the market. If that's signaling that we're interested in growing in the phosphate market, you absolutely heard right. We'd like to be -- have a bigger footprint in the market. That's, in part, the reason we invested in the Ma'aden joint venture. Some years out, there could be a Ma'aden Phase 3, but we are going to continue to look for opportunities to be a bigger player in the -- in phosphate production. And ideally, to broaden our geographic presence, Latin America is an excellent -- is one of the fastest-growing agricultural regions in the world. If there was some way to get into the phosphate business in Latin America, we'd be interested in doing that. As you know in North America, we're pretty well limited on MAP and DAP production. However, we're limited because of the mining capacity and plant capacity, but what we've done is transform that commodity MAP, DAP business with our MicroEssentials products. We will, I see, get to a point that virtually 1/2 of our approximate 10 million tonne annual production will be a MicroEssentials product. This has been a tremendous product for the -- first of all, for the customer. Real value, we have demand exceeding our supply capacity, which is behind our approximate $250 million in investing our MicroEssentials production capacity. And we've got a multiyear expansion plan for MicroEssentials that will get us, I think, by the end of the decade to close to 1/2 of all our phosphates being our proprietary, highly-valued MicroEssentials products. So yes, I'm a booster of phosphates. It's been underappreciated these years. Its day is here, and we'd like to grow that business.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991

2715,Matthew J. Korn,"[""One question tactical and another one more big picture, I guess. First, if you could clarify, I think you mentioned that North American potash shipments, you saw, at least early on in the year, limited by inventory availability. Could you talk a little bit about what the underlying causes of this are? Are logistic constraints something that's still holding back some distribution capacity here in the states? And then, second, Jim, you spoke well of how, I think, the company's preparing and executing as you wait for an improvement of market conditions, but where are we, in your opinion, on the process of kind of going through the cycle and seeing crop prices recover somewhat? I took note you mentioned how farmers are surprised and that they're -- they still came to market, they're planting heavily. So is this year another one of the crop stock-building? Or do you kind of see this year-over-year decline in global K&P demand indicative of a meaningful turn in supply and better crop prices sooner than later?""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2716,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Matthew, a couple of thoughtful questions. I'm going to have Mike Rahm address the question about North American potash inventory availability, et cetera, and I'll touch on the -- where we believe we're in the ag cycle. Mike?""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2717,Michael Rahm,"[""Well, I think in the case of potash -- and then, Rick, you certainly can comment, but we've seen a fair amount of inventory move from producers downstream into the channel. If you follow the IPNI statistics, just a tremendous drop, about a 1.7 million tonne drop in producer-held potash inventories in North America. And then, I think that has moved into the system. And I don't think North American situation is unique. I think most producers around the globe have shipped very hard into the system, and certainly, the shipment numbers reflect that. You've probably seen our estimate of over 61 million tonnes, and that's probably at the low end of the range of some of the numbers that you've seen here recently. So I think the bottom line is there are inventories that have moved further downstream. And I think, in the case of where those are, we think China has a bit of inventory build. And in the U.S., I think retailers are in a much better position this year than a year ago. They've learned from some of the logistical problems and constraints. I think they see, probably, better-than-expected demand earlier in the year. So as you would expect at this point in time, I think the system is pretty well loaded for the spring season.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2718,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Thanks, Mike. The question about -- it's a good one about where we are in the ag cycle. And if you want a place, I'd say it's somewhere in the trough of the cycle. We've gone through a couple of years where the world has grown boomer crops, bumper crops. We've seen world grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios build, and that's taken some of the edge off of the grain prices. That said, farmers still remain profitable. Farmers have had 5 great, great years to build their balance sheets, to build their farming enterprises. And where we go next from here is the next crop that we're going to be planting. We're seeing a Brazilian soybean crop that is okay, a long ways to go yet, some drought impacts. It's not as big as we thought it is. We have a U.S. crop that, by the feel, by looking out my windows when I'm in Minneapolis, it looks like it's going to be an early season, much of the -- at least the Midwest, Boston, New York aside. They don't grow much corn. Other corn-growing areas don't have a lot of corn -- or a lot of snow, I should say, in the field. So it could be an early season. Farmers are going to get a lot of acres planted. And this supply of grain and oilseeds that we see come to market this next year is going to be telling. So that's the ag grain and oilseed side. The other side, rates to fertilizers is the supply side, and we've got a tightening market. We've lost some potash production to mine losses and mine closures. We have some new mines coming on stream. Phosphate, if anything, it's -- we're seeing less availability of phosphates, so it's a -- we feel good about the fundamentals of our crop nutrition industry. And I'm going to just have Mike add one comment here.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2719,Michael Rahm,"[""I'll just make a quick comment, Jim. I -- as you said, we've had tremendous crops with average yields well above trend. If you simply do the math and farm with spreadsheets, I think, as Vincent Andrews has coined, and just -- and take a look at, if next year, we get a trend yield worldwide and we get trend growth in demand, we're going to pull down inventories. And then, I think that goes back to what we've always said, that the long-term food story is still very much intact and that we're going to have to continue to increase planted area and continue to grow crops and achieve trend yields in order to meet demand. And I think that's the bottom line. We certainly haven't changed our view in terms of long-term positive outlook for global agriculture.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991

Clearly, there -- you had the proving runs as you're running Colonsay very hard. Your Carlsbad's out of the system, that gives you a little bit of a cost tailwind, but expectations on unit costs on potash. And maybe second question, and it ties in a little bit, can you think about the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar on your business? Clearly, there's some Canadian dollar tailwind in potash, but impact on your customers as you think about a stronger dollar impact on commodity prices and production costs for some of your customers in emerging markets.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2722,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Welcome, Adam. I'm going to have Joc O'Rourke speak to the production cost for potash in the coming year, and I'll have some comments about the currency question.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2723,James C. O'Rourke,"[""So Adam, I'm going to incorporate a little bit of what you've asked Jim in this as well. So our production costs last quarter were $91 cash per tonne, which included $17 of brine inflow cost. That really is a -- probably the best indicator right now of where we are with respect to our cost per tonne, although we expect some -- we expect the improvement as we reduce our -- some of our cost initiatives. But it really shows the leverage we've got now already. And if you look going forward, a lot of that is our cost savings. Not just the U.S. dollar, but the Canadian dollar is also giving us a pretty good tailwind. So we expect, if we can run hard, we're going to be in that kind of $74 a tonne plus the brine cost of, say, $17. So that's pretty good indication of where we'll be going forward.""]",question_answer,MOS_78991
2724,James T. Prokopanko,"[""All right. Adam, on the currency question. Stronger U.S. dollar, Joc made a good point that the Potash business, we have a dollar-denominated costs there, that Canadian dollar's come down relative to the U.S. dollar, but nothing like the ruble. The Belarusian and the Russian ruble are well, well off, we all know. So that has undoubtedly given the Russian and Belarusian producers some advantage, yet it's not -- their business isn't all run on rubles. They have euro and U.S.-denominated debt. They -- their suppliers are typically the miners and the equipment suppliers are typically other non-Russian companies. So they're paying for much part of their expenses in U.S. dollars. However, they're going to have labor costs that are lower. And with time, that is going to adjust. When you have these Maxi devaluations that go on, you see inflation come roaring into those geographies. So we think this is going to be, at most, a temporary advantage to those producing in devalued currency. On the farm side, many crops are denominated in U.S. dollars. So with this decline in the Brazilian real, I think we're down 30% on the real value, that is -- or close to 30%, that is resulting in close to a 30% increase in the U.S. dollar -- in the amount of U.S. dollars that a Brazilian farmer gets. Their expenses are going to be a little higher, but the margin they're going to make is going to be larger because of a stronger U.S. dollar. So net-net, with lower fuel costs, low interest rates, I don't think this is going to be damaging to our farmer customer by seeing the strong U.S. dollar."", ""With that, we're going to conclude the call.

2728,Jim Prokopanko,"['Good morning and thank you for joining our third quarter 2014 earnings discussion. We reported solid earnings for the quarter, given the challenging business environment across agriculture. We drilled progress on costs and delivered good operating performance, while we will provide some color on those results, I realize the elephant in the room is not our third quarter results. The elephant in the room is the near term future, so we’ll spend a significant amount of time there. We want you to take away three important concepts from this call; first, we believe the current negative sentiment that is pervasive amongst agriculture investors is overblown and that the weakness in Ag equities provides compelling opportunity for companies and investors alike. Even the more recent U.S. -- forecast indicate farmer income this year will be the fourth highest in history. The uncertainty is for 2015, where today farmers can still pre-sell their corn for around $4 per bushel and their soybeans for around $10 a bushel.', 'Second, this is a cyclical business and we at Mosaic have been through many cycles. Agricultural commodity prices are indeed lower. The cycle will play out and prices will rise again. Third and most important, Mosaic is in excellent condition to whether the current economic environment sees opportunities as they arise and outperform when conditions improve.', 'We manage for the long term, because the long term holds great opportunities for this business. Before I explore those topics in more depth, I’ll provide a bit of an insight into our performance for the quarter. We generated net earnings of $202 million or $0.54 per share on net sales of $2.3 billion, compared with net earnings of $124 million and net sales of $1.9 billion in the third quarter of 2013.', 'We continue to generate strong operating cash flow of $489 million during the quarter bringing our year-to-date cash flow to $1.9 billion, a $400 million improvement over the same period a year ago. We are putting our cash to use by continuing to invest in the business and repurchasing our shares while still retaining $3 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand as of the end of the quarter.', 'Global demand for potash and phosphates remained strong during the quarter. Our shipment volumes came in at the low end of the original guidance range. In potash because of primarily weather related production issues in Saskatchewan and New Mexico which underscore the tight inventory situation we highlighted on the last call, and in phosphates because of the timing of some quarter and the shipments.', 'Phosphate prices declined somewhat even as costs rose for raw materials especially ammonia. As we announced last month, we will curtail phosphates production in response to these conditions and we will continue to produce with economic discipline limiting the amount of high cost inventory we carry into the spring season.', 'In potash, prices improved, and as we discussed during our last call Canpotex was fully subscribed. Customers in North America saw [clock] in potash for fall application early, because of the fears of our overburdened rail system as well as low producer and channel inventory. Indeed potash inventories are very low. We are producing at high rates just to meet current demand.', 'In terms of global shipments, we lowered both 2014 and 2015 global phosphate shipments forecast by roughly a million tonnes in part due to India importing more phosphoric acid for NPK production and we are maintaining our outlook for global potash shipments.', 'Now, I’ll turn to our views of the current agricultural markets. Farmers in North America are finishing a record harvest, spurred by mostly favorable economics when farmers were making planting decisions and ideal weather in the growing season across the corn belt. This will be the second bin busting harvest in a row, and while that bounty is good for global food security, it brings with it prospects of lower income for farmers in 2015, so what happens from here? We know farmers are going to farm and when they do we are confident they will follow good business economics and work to maximize yields from every planted acre. Certainly farmers will tighten their belts. We expect land rents to decline, we expect some land to be taken out of production and equipment purchasing decisions to be deferred and we expect farmers to ring every penny a value out of the cash they commit to inputs.', 'Think about it this way. If you buy a thorough bred race horse, you are not going to try to recoup your cost by not feeding it, so we disagree with the belief among some analysts who suggest potash and phosphate useful crop in 2015. In fact, we expect global demand for potash and phosphates to remain strong and even grow in 2015.', 'Here’s why, first, the USDA expects the 2014 global harvest to come in a few bushel shy of 3 billion tonnes, a record on top of last year’s record. That much grain takes enormous amounts of nutrients from the soil and those nutrients need to be replaced. When farmers plant their fields, they will fertilize.', 'Second, precision agriculture technology has made tremendous progress since the last downturn in grain and oilseed prices. Today, in pursuit of maximal efficiency and sound nutrient stewardship farmers test soil and apply precisely the nutrients for soil needs for the next growing season. This approach has the effect with smoothing demand for our products across the cycle compared with earlier cycles.', 'Third, the argument that unused phosphorous will carry over in the soil from one season to the next is much too simplistic. The phosphorous cycle is complex chemistry but suffices to say that phosphate must be applied for each new crop. The benefit of skipping an application cycle is deminimus at today’s prices, a much different story than when DAP was $1100 per tonne. You can read more about this topic in the most recent addition of Market Mosaic which is available on our website.', 'And finally, at current prices, potash and phosphate remain affordable just as we want them to be. Our views are playing out in the market. Global demand remains strong until the fall of season for both of our nutrients and prices are stable to reflect the demand. I want to be clear. We fully understand the situation facing grained farmers and we know they will have to make tough decisions as they prepare for the next planting cycle. We also know that this trough of the cycle is the first series dip in many years, so observers who entered the business in boom times are having difficulty seeing a longer horizon, but the agricultural environment can change quickly. One poor global crop would change sentiment and global food security dramatically.', 'Overtime regardless of the current crop outlook we know that demand for food and crop nutrients will rise and therein lies the opportunity I mentioned earlier. As we demonstrated with our many strategic moves, the engines of growth are cheapest to build at the low part of the cycle. We are making good progress on our strategic initiatives. I’ll provide a few updates. We are on track to complete the acquisition of ADMs distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay by the end of the year. We are well along the process of planning for integration. Once complete the acquisition will enable us to expand our distribution in Brazil from 4 million tonnes to 6 million and capture a bigger percentage of the incremental value from our premium micro essentials products and one of the most dynamic agricultural markets in the world. The remaining potash expansion our key three shots at Esterhazy continues on budget and on time.', 'We closed the sale of a decommissioned Hersey, Michigan line and have signed an agreement to sell our distribution business in Argentina. We are on pace and realizing the targeted synergies from the CF phosphates acquisition. The proximity of assets and the excellent cultural fit are proving quite valuable. We are also making investments to create further efficiencies in our phosphates business. We are investigating further de-bottle necking for ammonia production because we like the stability of supply we generate from manufacturing a portion of the ammonia we require. We are in the process of converting two granulation facilities to produce more micro essentials. And we are investing in sulphur melting capacity to give us greater sulphur sourcing flexibility', 'At the modern project we are ramping up hiring and a significant portion of the capital required for the project will be put to work in 2015. We are already seeing steel and concrete rising from the ground. All these moves contribute to our well defined strategy. They provide us with growing production capacity, increased operational efficiency and growing and a stable market access. We are beginning to realize the benefits of these investments and are positioned for strong volume and cash flow growth as the cycle moves forward.', 'Finally, I’ll leave the details on capital and expenses to Rich, but I want to mention that our capital structure continues to improve and we are ahead of schedule on our efforts to remove about $500 million in expenses from our two business units and our corporate functions. Now, before I offer some closing thoughts, Rich Mack, our CFO will discuss our results.']",management_discussion,MOS_74616
2729,Richard Mack,"['Thank you, Jim and good morning to you all. This morning I will provide a brief discussion of our business, segment financial results for the third quarter share some insight on our capital and close by providing guidance for the fourth quarter. In the phosphate segment, our results were in line with guidance. Volumes, prices and margin rate were generally consistent with our expectations. We are encouraged with what we see in phosphates and view this to be in increasingly positive story for Mosaic. That said however, and as we previewed in our press release on September 30, we believe that raw material prices particularly ammonia continue to be out of line with the price levels and other agricultural commodities, which is why we decided to curtail some phosphate production during the fourth quarter. This disconnect is compounded by the fact that we are entering a seasonally slow period for phosphate sales.', 'For clarity, we are going to take a measured approach to the curtailment. We will produce enough fertilizer to meet customer needs and we do not plan on curtailing our micro essentials production. We will evaluate our production levels daily with the objective of entering the spring application season with minimal high cost ammonia in finished product inventory.', 'In the potash segment our results were close to our expectations aside from isolated production issues, which were primarily weather related. That impacted our operating rate by several percentage points. We lost some production days during the quarter at both Belle Plaine and Carlsbad because of summer storms. While our year-over-year cash cost per tonne were roughly flat, in September for example the potash team delivered cash costs of $103 per tonne, including Brine management cost of $19 per tonne. These costs are at their lowest level in recent years even with lower operating rates and demonstrate that our cost reduction initiatives are beginning to take hold.', 'Now, I’ll move on to our capital. I provided a fairly in-depth discussion of our capital philosophy a quarter ago, so I won’t repeat all that information today. Instead, I would like to make just a couple of points. First, to reinforce Jim’s message the low [Arkenles] cycle clearly provides opportunities for the strongest companies and Mosaic has a very strong financial foundation. We’ve put a lot of capital to work over the past 18 months and we will continue to do so as compelling opportunities arise. This is how we built this business in my years at Cargill being financially sound and looking for opportunities at the low end of the cycle.', 'In this regard we have worked hard to optimize our balance sheet with the addition of $2.8 billion of attractively priced debt over the past 12 months including $800 million in the third quarter. We are using this cash to execute on strategic initiative, CF, Ma’aden, the ADM distribution business and an attractive Mosaic share price. On that note we have been repurchasing shares in the open market during our open trading windows as well as through a recently implemented 10b5-1 trading program.', 'Since our last earnings call we have repurchased 3.5 million shares in the open market. That makes our total share repurchases $2.6 billion in the last 12 months or about 13% of our outstanding share account. Second, as a result of the CF and ADM acquisitions we have decided to slightly adjust our capital management philosophy by increasing our targeted liquidity buffer to $2.5 billion from $2.25 billion as a result of increased working capital requirements. This change increases our on-balance sheet cash target to $1 billion. As of the end of the third quarter, we have approximately $1billion and excess cash above this newly revised liquidity buffer after taking into account cash that will be used to fund the ADM acquisition by the end of the year and funding a trust fund for our asset retirement obligations which is likely to happen sometime in 2015.', 'Now I’d like to provide our guidance for the fourth quarter which tends to be a seasonally slow period for us. In phosphates we expect margins to be in the mid teens, while operating rates to be in the 70% to 80% range, which is a lower and wider range due to the curtailment we have discussed. Sales volumes are expected to range from 2.5 to 2.8 million tonnes for the fourth quarter. This compares the 3.4 million tonnes in last year’s period when volumes were unusually high as low prices and sentiment changes led to a significant sales in North America. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $430 to $450 per tonne.', 'In potash, we anticipate that our mines will operate at high rates to begin to replenish extraordinary low inventory levels and to meet global demand including and expected new contract with Chinese customers.', 'In the fourth, we expect to continue to make significant deliveries under the old contract which will increase the proportion of international standard sales in our product mix negatively impacting our expected average MOP pricing.', 'We expect potash sales to be in range of 2.0 to 2.3 million tonnes during the fourth, compared to actual volumes of 1.9 million tonnes in the same period last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $275 to $295 per tonne.', 'The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the mid 30% range. Our operating rate in potash is expected to be in the range of 85% to 90%. We are narrowing our 2014 Canadian resource taxes and royalties to be in the range of $175 million to $200 million, compared to prior guidance of $170 million to $210 million. And our guidance for full year brine management expenses is unchanged at approximately $200 million.', 'We are also lowering our estimated SG&A expenses to a range of $380 million to $395 million for calendar 2014, with the midpoint of the range down $25 million from the beginning of the year as a result of our progress on cost savings initiatives.', 'Note, these numbers include $10 million in charges incurred to achieve these cost savings initiatives, so we are off to a good start on this front. For the year we estimate an effective tax rate excluding discrete items continuing in the high 20% range. We continue to expect a normalized tax rate in the low to mid 20% range for 2015 and thereafter.', ""And finally, our expectation for capital expenditures and equity investments remains in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.2 billion including investments in the Ma'aden joint venture."", 'In closing, I have a couple of miscellaneous remarks. First as Jim noted, we anticipate that we will close on the ADM acquisition by the end of the calendar year. Assuming that to be case, we plan to manage and report a new international distribution segments starting in 2015.', 'This approach will provide enhanced disclosure and transparency in our phosphates business, as well as with our larger international distribution business. We anticipate providing you with historical data during the first quarter of 2015.', 'And second, from time-to-time in my new role I hear questions relating to a perceived remaining overhang resulting from the Class A share held by Cargill family members and trusts. If such a perception exists, it should not.', 'There are less than 35 million Class A shares outstanding and they are held by several separate and distinct owners and trusts. In November, 2014 just next month 17 million of these shares will convert into freely tradable common shares and a year later all of the reaming restricted shares will also convert to common.', 'While this diversified group of Cargill family owners and trust will obviously have full discretion over their ultimate disposition we would not expect significant selling given the tax implications associated with these shares.', 'With that, thank you for time this morning, and I’m going to turn the call back over to Jim for his concluding remarks.']",management_discussion,MOS_74616
2730,Jim Prokopanko,"['Thank you, Rich. The economic environment on the farm has changed. Corn selling at 350 per bushel remains us after a long run of remarkable farm profitability, that food supply can still get ahead of demand, if only temporarily. And tough times for farmers lead to leaner times across the Ag factor. We are ready for this at Mosaic.', 'We’ve been through $3 corn and $9 soybeans. We’ve been through $200 potash and we’ve seen the over exuberance or $1,000 potash. Through all that, we’ve stayed our course. We will remain confident about the agricultural markets and we’ve made tough decisions when necessary and bold decisions when they held big promise.', 'Listen, this is a tough business and a tough business to predict. Agriculture is subject to a myriad of forces, economic, social, political, environmental and otherwise. Farmers and agro business make decisions about the future with many variables unknown. But they and we return to the simple concept that the world needs all the food they can grow and it needs a lot more of that food in the coming years.', 'I will skip the food story details for now and I will let this suffice. Short term volatility is a fact of life in agriculture, but long-term demand growth is also a fact of life and lives. Mosaic is exactly where we wanted to be, and we’ve made bold investments for growth.', 'We’ve reduced our costs. We build an efficient balance sheet.

I think in terms of our projections for 2015 you’ve seen our forecast for shipments, we expect that potash shipments will increase from I think our point estimate for 2014 is 57.8, we think there’s another million tonne increase in 2015 to about 58.8 or so. In the case of phosphates we expect to go from the mid 64 million tonne range in to the kind of 66 million tonne range.', 'So, we expect demand growth maybe slows a little bit from the rapid pace that we’ve seen in 2014.

In the case of potash, I think that translates into about 82% operating rate or so worldwide, in the case of phosphates, about 86%.', 'So, as we said, our long-term outlook shows a fairly well balanced situation.

And if you go back to 2007 the year before the big drop in shipments, we’re shipping 50 million tonnes approximately a year.', 'Today we’re going to ship 65 million tonnes of finished phosphates. From 2008 we’re up almost 20 million tonnes, and on global potash, again, we’re going to see another record.

That started to occur as we’ve got a good chunk of the soybeans in the bean and what’s happening is farmers are slow to come in, but when they make the decision they’re not cutting application rates. We’re seeing the same thing and planning in Brazil where the planting is delayed, yet farmers aren’t cutting back anyway on the amount of phosphates they use.', 'So that’s what we see happening at the farm gate level. The other piece I think I’d add Jim to our strategy is we’ve continued to focus on building out our premium products, so that in phosphates in those key and growing markets in Brazil and North America in the Caribbean Basin, we’ve been able to supply a bigger percentage of our business as MicroEssentials and less is DAP.']",question_answer,MOS_74616

And we are spending considerable effort and time internally looking at how we can avoid the hassle we faced last year with railway shipping product, railway shipping issues and what is becoming a growing challenge on the barge system.', 'So there is a lot of uncertainties still remaining about our capacity this year to recover from the hole that was dug last year and not being able to get product to either domestic or international customers on a timely basis, particularly when I speak international customers I’m referring to potash shipments out of Western Canada. It’s a challenge we put to our dealer customers that we just can’t FedEx this product a week in advance of when they need to sell it to the supplier. We’ve got to take up over a month to six weeks to position or train, get it shipped and get it delivered. So you put your finger on a real emerging and developing issues what position the dealers take in storing product and this is – here is a good example of farmers delaying decision making, so dealers are reluctant to make the decision of loading up their warehouses if they don’t know the farmers are taking. So this is backing up the system and what we’re doing is where we can position products further in country closer to those dealers, with dealers and be ready for potential problems in the delivery.

And I think that’s the part that we have to look at going forward.

When we get to a few years out in terms of capital, I think that you are going to see that there should be a step function change in terms of what our capital requirements would be, again, it’s all dependant on what sort of opportunities we see in terms of organic growth and strategic growth opportunities but you -- we should see some of the cost savings that we are achieving results in 2015, 2016 or probably thereafter I mean these targets remember are 2018 targets and less capital being used by the organization.']",question_answer,MOS_74616

2785,Andrew Wong,"['Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask actually about the Indian potash and phosphate market and the subsidy expectations you’ve built into your demand forecast for next year. Do you expect the subsidy to rise along with the prices like in particularly with the potash market and if it doesn’t how will that impact demand and will prices have to adjust to accommodate dealer margins, just wondering your thoughts? Thanks.']",question_answer,MOS_74616
2786,Jim Prokopanko,"['Okay, Andrew good morning and welcome. I’m going to turn it over after just the opening comment here to Rick and to Mike Rahm. It’s something we are watching carefully with the change in leadership in India we are seeing the – we are starting to see the signs of real reform and we are hopeful and pragmatically hopeful that we are going to see true reform to the subsidy program. The new leadership there is some small things that have already been signaled, we’ve gotten distribution rights for potash and into India something that we’ve been trying to achieve for a couple of years, new leadership in India and quickly we saw that request met. So that’s giving us a real hope that we are going to see changes to the entire agricultural system and specifically nutrient reform. Rick, do you want to add some color on that?']",question_answer,MOS_74616
2787,Richard Mack,"['Yes just add a couple of things. There is – I visited with some of the industry people from India in Singapore on Monday evening at a [Capitex] event and they talked about finally being in a position that the government is going to focus on real change. And what that means is trying to get to the balance crop nutrition that they have set off, that they need to get to. And people are very, very positive that’s going to happen. I think probably what’ s more so then what’s going on with prices of P&K they are going to have to deal with the difference between nitrogen pricing and P&K pricing. And so what that change looks like I think we have to be patient for it to take place but if you used 2014 as a guide we saw it growth in both P&K imports and applications and a change to the nitrogen subsidy would only support that continuing.']",question_answer,MOS_74616
2788,Michael Rahm,"['And Rick, I’d just add a couple of points. As I said earlier, we are banking on India for picking up the pace in terms of their P&K imports. We think phosphate imports will be up to around 5.5 million tonnes of DAP in calendar year 2015 and MLP imports probably in that 4.5 million tonne range. The one thing I would add farm economics in India are great. Their minimum support prices are at relatively high levels, more moderate international prices are more stable, rupee has really caused import economics to work. So in terms of our demand forecast we don’t see changes, any changes in subsidy policy jeopardizing the demand outlook in India. The other thing I would add is that with the crop and petroleum prices, it takes a lot of pressure off the government in terms of its overall subsidy bill because petroleum takes up a pretty big chunk of that. So I think there will be a little bit less pressure to squeeze the balloon a little bit harder on the P&K side.']",question_answer,MOS_74616

Third and most important Mosaic is in an excellent condition to thrive across the cycle.

I am delighted to inform you, that he will be returning to his duties full time on August 4th, and he is with us this morning. It has been an honor to fill in for him during his absence.', ""Now let's get to business; we have three key messages for you today. First, global demand for fertilizer was and is very strong. Second, despite lower agricultural commodity prices, farmers around the world continue to have strong incentive to maximize their yields; and third, Mosaic continues to put its capital to use to grow the company, and reward investors."", ""First, let's discuss the demand picture. Demand for phosphate and potash was strong in all key agricultural areas of the world, so strong in fact, that producers are struggling to keep up. For potash for example, we are fully committed through the third quarter."", 'For several quarters, we have been predicting that volumes would rise first, followed by prices, and indeed this is happening. We have seen steady volume growth since the end of last year, and prices eventually followed; first in phosphates and then in potash.', 'The second quarter played out as we expected. We saw strong sales volumes, and an uptick in potash prices. Phosphate prices were solid around the globe, and the seasonal dip in phosphate shipments was limited as we predicted. The strength in phosphate prices without major market participation from India was somewhat unexpected, with their total imports of phosphate at only 1.5 million tonnes year-to-date. We continue to expect India to import 4.5 million to 5 million tonnes of DAP this year, which should further support prices in the second half.', 'Potash prices have risen as well, with customers trying to lock in tonnes for the fall season. I say trying to lock-in tonnes, because supply is limited. Rick McLellan and I recently traveled to visit customers in the corn belt, and we saw empty potash bin after empty potash bin, simply put, the cupboard was bare.', ""Customers are motivated to have tonnes in inventory for a good fall application season. They know producer inventories are very limited, and they expect potential logistical issues this fall, when an anticipated large harvest will be competing with other commodities for a limited number of railcars and barges. Geopolitical issues in the Ukraine and Israel, as well as typhoon damage in China are adding further uncertainty to near term logistics challenges. All these uncertainties are highlighting Mosaic's strengths. Our customers value the security of supply we can provide, thanks to our unique mix of assets, global reach and talent."", 'In both phosphates and potash, we are maintaining our global shipment forecast, which are 65 million to 66 million tonnes, and 57 million to 58 million tonnes respectively. These forecasts for global shipments have not changed all year, and they were consistently above the rest of the markets, and now others have revised their numbers upward.', 'While business conditions have improved, we are maintaining our focus on execution. We are making good progress toward our goals to generate $0.5 billion in cost savings from our two business units and our corporate functions.', 'Strong global demand and rising prices, coupled with lower controllable operating expenses, drove solid financial results for the quarter. We generated net earnings of $248 million or $0.64 per share on net sales of $2.4 billion, compared with net earnings of $430 million and net sales of $2.6 billion in the second calendar quarter of 2013. We continue to generate strong operating cash flow with nearly $800 million during the quarter. Even as we fund our capital commitments, we are maintaining a solid cash cushion, with $2.4 billion of cash and cash equivalents on hand.', 'We continue to make important strategic progress and we are successfully executing the many initiatives we announced over the past year. We have asked the organization to absorb a great deal of additional effort, from acquisition integration to balance sheet optimization to production capacity expansion, and I am proud of the excellent and diligent work our team is producing. We are energized by the outcomes our strategic moves will provide, and by the ever present long term promise of our mission, to help the world grow the food it needs.', 'I would like to provide a few updates on our strategic accomplishments. First, our potash expansions remain on schedule and on budget. The new shaft at the Esterhazy K3 mine has reached a depth of more than 1,700 feet, and has moved through the Blairmore Water Formation, while the north shaft has reached 1,500 feet, and will soon emerge from the Blairmore. Despite recent volatility in potash demand, we have continued our steady and safe progress on these major projects. New potash capacity does not come cheap or easily, and it requires both a disciplined approach and conviction in the long term demand story. While we have throttled back future expansion plans, our conviction persists in our ongoing projects, because we know the world is going to need our additional production capacity.', ""Second, we expect to close the ADM distribution acquisition in Brazil and Paraguay near the end of the year. We have received clearance from Brazilian antitrust authorities, and we have teams working to prepare for integration of the ADM business and its 500 plus employees. Once the acquisition is completed, we expect to increase our distribution in the world's most promising agricultural area, from 4 million to 6 million tonnes annually, and we expect to have a strong platform for future growth."", ""Third, the CF industry's phosphate integration has gone exceptionally well. Our cultures have fit well together, and the former CF employees are enthusiastic about being part of the Mosaic term. The former CF facilities are meeting our production and cost expectations. Given current price and volume trends in the industry, this deal was very well timed."", 'Fourth, expansion of our MicroEssentials production capacity continues on-schedule and on-budget. We are converting part of our New Wales facility in Florida, to help us meet the growing demand for our phosphate based premium product, which creates incremental value for growers, distributors and Mosaic.', ""Fifth, the Ma'aden joint venture is also on track, and we reached an important milestone in June. We and our partners at Ma'aden and SABIC secured $5 billion in financing for the project, with 20 financial institutions participating. Once complete, the joint venture is expected to be the lowest cost phosphate operation in the world, and it will have a logistical advantage to key Asian geographies."", 'Sixth, our portfolio improvements continued during the quarter. we sold our decommissioned potash mine in Hersey, Michigan, and its new owner will now operate it as a salt mine. We are also working toward a sale of our distribution business in Argentina, and we will soon cease operations in Chile.', 'In addition, we made the decision to stop MOP production at our Carlsbad, New Mexico potash mine. Production costs at Carlsbad was significantly higher than at our Canadian mines, in large part because of the problematic rock reserve in the Carlsbad basin. We will only produce K-Mag, our premium potash product at Carlsbad going forward.', 'These divestitures and production decisions have been difficult, but all of them were the right call for the company and our shareholders. We expect enhanced profitability without sacrificing our ability to meet global demand for potash and phosphates.', ""Seventh and perhaps most important, we continue to generate strong and improving safety performance, with our key measure of injuries improving by 15% over last year's record performance."", 'Finally, we have continued to make great progress toward our goal of more efficient balance sheet. We have done what we said we would do, using our capital to create value. I will leave the capital details to Rich Mack.', 'By my count, we have announced a dozen significant strategic decisions since the beginning of 2013, and all of them are proceeding as planned. These are differentiating us from our peers, as we are balancing significant internal and external investments with substantial shareholder distributions. It’s a track record we are proud of, and more importantly, it signals our unwavering confidence in the future prospects for this business.', 'Now before Jim provides some concluding thoughts on the markets and the quarters ahead, I would like to welcome Rich Mack to the call. As you know, Rich is our new CFO. He has been a highly effective, and influential leader at Mosaic since our founding, and has made a successful transition into his new role. Many of you have already spoken with Rich, and I know, he is eager to build relationships across the investment community in the months ahead. Rich?']",management_discussion,MOS_70457
2794,Richard Mack,"['Thank you, Larry, and good morning to everyone on the call. As some of you know, Larry and I have worked very closely together on material decisions impacting Mosaic, since the company was formed in 2004. In fact, we were the very first employees of this company.', ""With Larry's announced retirement at the end of the calendar year, let me just say that I have a tremendous amount of respect for him, and have been very fortunate to work with him for the past 10 years. He has been a remarkable mentor, and I will work diligently to continue his track record highlighted by unwavering integrity and consistently transparent investor communications."", 'Turning now to the quarter; I am pleased that my first quarter in the CFO position was strong, and the capital markets were relatively uneventful, notwithstanding rising geopolitical uncertainty. The successful execution of our strategies at Mosaic continues to unfold, and I look forward to additional steady and measured progress in the future.', 'I will start with a brief discussion of our business segment financial results for the quarter, provide some insight on our capital management philosophy, and close by providing our guidance for the third quarter.', ""In phosphates, the price momentum that began last winter resumed again this quarter, with average selling prices reaching $465 per tonne. The price improvements were driven by strong demand in low producer pipeline inventories. We sold 3.4 million tonnes of finished phosphate products during the quarter, which was at the top end of our guidance range, with particularly strong demand for the North American spring planting season. This quarter represents the first full quarter of production and sales from our CF Phosphate's acquisition, and as a result, it was a near record quarter in terms of volume."", 'Our operating rate in phosphates was 85%, which was in line with prior guidance. Our gross margin rate in phosphates was 17%, which was flat with last year, as margins were negatively impacted by about three percentage points, as a result of accounting impacts from the acquisition. This $36 million non-cash impact will not continue, however the acquisition will drive higher ongoing depreciation, repletion and amortization of about $8 million per quarter from the step-up in asset values. Operating earnings for the segment were $206 million, compared with $191 million a year ago.', 'In our potash business, prices continue to support our belief that we reached a floor earlier this year. Average selling prices per MOP were $267 per tonne for the quarter. We shipped 2.5 million tonnes of potash, which was near the top end of our guidance range. Our operating rate came in at 76%, negatively impacted by unplanned downtime at our Carlsbad mine, in a longer than expected turnaround at [indiscernible]. The potash segment generated operating earnings of $213 million, compared with $346 million in the second quarter of 2013, driven by lower realized prices, a lower operating rate, higher depreciation, which was partially offset by an unrealized gain on derivatives, primarily FX, in cost of goods sold.', ""Turning now to Mosaic's capital management philosophy. As Mosaic's new CFO, I'd like to spend a little time reviewing our capital allocation. What we have done, and what you can expect going forward, we have made nearly $9 billion in capital commitments over the past two years, with the majority of the capital being invested in growth initiatives. We have long believed that smart long term capital allocation is essential to creating shareholder value in this industry."", 'We have also optimized our asset portfolio through the divestitures and production decisions Larry highlighted earlier on this call. I should note that we expect to record charges, largely non-cash for the decommissioning of MOP production at Carlsbad in the third and fourth quarters.', 'In our view, Mosaic has been, by far, the most aggressive company in the industry during the weak part of the business cycle, and we have not deviated from our often stated philosophy, which is to invest first in organic growth and maintenance of our assets. Then in financially appealing acquisitions and joint ventures, followed by distributions of excess cash to shareholders. As a result, we are in excellent position for the stronger parts of the cycle, while continuing to maintain a very solid financial foundation.', 'In addition to the business initiatives Larry mentioned, the $9 billion shown on this slide, includes more than $1 billion allocated to our maintenance and reliability programs, which results in greater productivity levels, and helps ensure the safety of our employees.', 'Notably, we have also allocated over $3 billion in capital distribution to shareholders. We have paid over $800 million in dividends, and funded $2.4 billion in share repurchases, including the Class A share repurchasing agreement, which coincidentally was completed yesterday. We have a remaining authorization of $600 million for additional share repurchases.', ""This is a heavy list of accomplishments in a short period of time. we don't believe you will find any other company in our space as committed to capital stewardship and leveraging it to create value for our shareholders."", 'Larry and I also work closely on the development of our financial targets in early 2013, and I remain committed to our financial philosophy. We have deployed significant capital, and we continue to make progress in optimizing our balance sheet, while maintaining a cushion appropriate for the cyclicality of our business.', 'That said, we are growing. We have invested for growth, and we expect to review our options to redeploy the excess cash flow we generate from that growth. Our targeted cash liquidity buffer is $2.25 billion, which is comprised of $750 million on balance sheet, and our unused credit revolver. As of June 30, we had on-balance sheet cash and cash equivalents of $2.4 billion.', 'Subsequent to the dollar, we have repurchased approximately $300 million of stock from the Margaret A. Cargill Trusts. In addition, we have committed $350 million for our pending Brazil acquisition, and expect to set aside about $625 million for our asset retirement obligations under RCRA. This leaves us near term resources of about $400 million in excess cash.', 'Our targeted adjusted debt-to-EBITDA is 1.5 to 2 times and we are in this range now. Remember, our primary objectives for these metrics are to optimize our balance sheet, while maintaining our credit rating.', 'So, where are we today? We are comfortable with our stated liquidity and debt targets as of now. But we expect to review usage of excess cash as our business grows. We are mindful of our strong cash position, and we expect to generate strong cash flow from operations going forward. If we are not able to find adequate uses for this cash, whether internally or through strategic investments, you can expect that we will return excess amounts to shareholders.', ""Going forward, the amount and timing of shareholder distributions will be dependent on the investment opportunities we see, including Mosaic's stock."", 'I would also note that as of today, I have been in this role for about two months, and I am very excited about the great hand I have been dealt, in terms of our current and future financial capabilities. I look forward to sharing more information with you on this topic in the months ahead.', 'Finally, I will discuss our guidance for the third quarter of 2014; our outlook remains positive, with the expectation of a strong third quarter, followed by the traditional seasonal slowdown in the fourth quarter. In the near term, we expect stable margins and high operating rates in phosphates, and with strong potash sales expectations, we anticipate that our potash mines will operate at full capacity rates, following scheduled maintenance downtime. Of course, many unknowns will influence the environment, including U.S. crop progress, as well as demand from India, exports from China, and the developing geopolitical unrest around the world.', ""Global demand prospects continue to look very promising, despite the lower prevailing agricultural commodity prices. We continue to project that global shipments of the main finish phosphate products will increase nearly 4% to a record 65 m n to 66 million tonnes this year, and that global potash shipments will rise by 7%, or nearly 4 million tonnes, to 57 million to 58 million tonnes in 2014. In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 3.3 million to 3.6 million tonnes for the third quarter, and our inventories are expected to remain limited. This compares to 2.7 million tonnes in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $440 to $470 per tonne. Mosaic's phosphate operating rate is expected to approach 90% during the third quarter, while the phosphate segment gross margin rate is expected to be in the middle to high teens."", 'On the potash side, we expect the sales volumes to be in the range of 1.8 million to 2 million tonnes during the third quarter, compared with actual volumes of 1.4 million tonnes in the same period last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $275 to $295 per tonne. The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the high 20% to low 30% range. With strong global demand, we are fully committed for the third quarter. Our operating rate in potash will reflect required maintenance downtime, and is expected to be in the low 70% range.', 'Our 2014 Canadian resource taxes and royalties increased to a range of $170 million to $110 million, due to higher income in Canada. And full year brine management expenses are expected to remain around $200 million, with slightly higher spending in the second half of 2014, compared to first six months.', 'We estimate SG&A expenses to be approximately $390 million to $400 million in calendar 2014, which is lower than prior guidance, due to the accelerated impact of our expense savings initiatives. These expenses include charges related to cost savings initiatives, and our phosphate acquisition.', ""For the year, we estimate an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, continuing in the mid to high 20% range. The tax rate is being driven higher by our decision to repatriate cash from Canada, which resulted in higher non-cash expenses. All else equal, it is reasonable to expect our tax rate to return to the low to mid 20% range for 2015. And finally, our expectations for capital expenditures and equity investments declined to the range of $1 billion to $1.2 billion, including investments in the Ma'aden joint venture, reflecting about $200 million of investments shifting into 2015."", 'With that, I look forward to getting to meet many of you over the next several months, and now I am very please to welcome Jim to the call, for his concluding comments.']",management_discussion,MOS_70457

Before I begin, I would like to thank Larry for so capably taking the helm, while I was out for the last couple of months. An interim role brings some unusual challenges, and I know that Larry has handled everything the job threw at him, with his usual grace and integrity.', 'I am pleased to report, that I will resume my full time duties next week. At that time, Larry will assume the previously announced role of Executive Vice President of Strategy and Business Development for the duration of 2014.', ""As our presentation today makes clear, we are feeling very good about the crop nutrition industry, and Mosaic's future prospects. We have seen the business improvements we expected, and we believe demand will remain solid at least through the fall season here in North America. Fertilizer inventories all over the world are reaching very low levels, particularly in India, where farmers are continuing to buy as little as possible, as they await evidence of the new government subsidy and other agricultural intentions."", 'As always, there are several factors to watch, including the Indian monsoon, China phosphate exports, the impacts of geopolitical conflicts, logistical issues, and of course, agricultural commodity prices.', ""Before we take your questions, I'd like to address the declines in corn and soybean prices, because I think its important that we put this short term commodity price weakness in perspective. Agriculture in 2014 is a vastly different and vastly more resilient business than it was even a decade ago. Today's farmers, in all of the key agricultural regions of the world, are using highly sophisticated technology. They have learned that they have to understand a wide range of global markets, and they manage their acreage and their herds for maximum economic yield. We believe that this period of lower grain and oilseed prices will be short lived, and that the modern farmer, as well as Mosaic, will weather it well."", 'We have ample evidence for this belief. First, farmers are more concerned about revenue per acre, than they are about price per bushel. They can increase through yields, and thus the revenue per acre, through the proper application of fertilizers.', 'Second, prudent farmers have very strong balance sheets, following the long run of high grain and oilseed prices. Farmers know that agriculture is cyclical, and they plan for and expect periods of lower prices.', 'Third for fertilizer producers, successive bumper crops are good news. Big crops deplete the soil of nutrients, which must be replenished to drive future big crops. Farmers are not going to pay for expensive [indiscernible], equipment and other inputs, then skimp-on fertilizer. That would be like buying a Ferrari and then not buying the gas to put it in.', 'Fourth, a likely early harvest will give farmers ample time to complete their fertilizer application in the fall, giving them a head start coming out of winter. This is another reason why we expect and are seeing strong demand for fall fertilizer application in North America.', 'Finally and most important, the tug of war between yields and demand will continue. Stocks to use ratios remain low, which is one reason why farmers planted 92 million acres of corn in the U.S. this year. They know the world is hungry, and that it is getting hungrier every day.', 'Volatility is a fact of life in agriculture, but so is the long upward trend of demand for food. This industry requires a long term view and the long term remains undoubtedly appealing.', 'Mosaic is in an excellent position to outperform over the long term. Our company has been public for nearly 10 years now, and in that time, we have accomplished a great deal. We have built a resilient franchise, that has demonstrated its ability to earn solid profits across the business cycle, and in recent times, we have taken advantage of the numerous opportunities to accelerate our progress.', 'I am thrilled to be back, primarily because I am so enthusiastic about the years ahead for Mosaic and all our stakeholders.', 'With that, I will turn the call back to Larry to moderate the Q&A session.

So the product that was in storage and was sold, went to the market in the spring, and was going to get shipped between now and the end of fall, which by the way, probably, will have a long tail, because you're going to get an early start to harvest, will get used up.

Most of that increase is in the form of DAP. But there is kind of a symbiotic relationship between China and India.

In the meantime, the price that Chinese -- or that Indian buyers are having to pay to get those tonnes out of China, has increased dramatically. I think at the start of their programs, they had a 450 number that they are able to buy for the latest -- their hearing is between 485 and 490.

We publish that each week on our web sites, last week, and let me just say, the affordability index is simply a ratio of ag commodity prices and crop nutrient prices.', 'Last week that was 0.88, and I think many people are looking back to the 2008 period and saying, my gosh, we are going to be in the same soup here, given the drop off in ag commodity prices. But just if you contrast today with 2008; if you go back to the peak of that affordability index, that peaked at 1.55 back in the first week of August in 2008, and at that time, the price of urea I think was $780, the price of DAP was $1,078, the price of MOP was $918. And interestingly, if you look at the price of ag commodities at that time, price of corn was 5.22, little bit higher than the 3.62 today and the price of soybeans was 12.43, not a heck of a lot different than the 12.21 that we see today.

So Mosaic has been shifting its strategy over the past years and what has been a volatile past year for both the phosphate and potash markets.

The company has nearly completed the balance sheet transformation. Speaking today is the Executive Vice President and CFO for Mosaic, Larry Stranghoener.""]",management_discussion,MOS_68670
2864,Lawrence Stranghoener,"[""Good morning, all. Thank you, Joel. It's always a pleasure to be at the BMO conference. You folks do conferences very well and we're pleased and honored to be here. I'm honored to have the 8 o'clock kick-off slot. Good morning to all of you early birds. It seems no matter what time I speak, I'm told that's the best time of the day to speak, so I'll take you at your word and say this is the best slot of the entire day, so we're pleased to be here."", ""I'll remind you as we start of our Safe Harbor statements and then I'll start my comments by giving you a quick overview of the industry as we see it and why we at Mosaic are such strong believers in the long-term fertilizer story. You've heard Jim and me, Jim our CEO and me talk about the foods story many times. Clearly the agricultural industry is volatile but the long-term outlook for food demand and thus for nutrient demand is highly compelling."", ""Since 1980 farm yields are up by nearly 60% but they're still struggling to keep up with demand growth because global population and human prosperity are both on the rise. Farmers around the world need sustainable yield improvement and crop nutrition is key to achieving that."", 'The recent and current operating environment has presented challenges for us but has also created investment opportunities for us and for you. Through the winter and still today moving product has been more difficult than in any year in recent history. A very harsh winter in Canada combined with a shortage of locomotives to move increasing volumes of Canadian commodities has restricted our ability to ship potash. The cold weather also left rivers frozen later into the spring than usual. While these conditions have mostly had a negative impact, one positive upshot was that our customers were willing to take on more risks to ensure they had product when they needed it this spring.', 'The markets for our two nutrients have been somewhat divergent recently. Prices for phosphates rose dramatically late in 2013 due to strong global demand and logistical problems encountered by some of our competitors. Prices have moderated recently with Chinese exports coming to market and shipping concerns abating. For the second half of this year, we think demand from India and the supply volumes from China will go a long way towards shaping prices.', 'In potash demand has been and remains quite strong while prices have remained near the floor established late last year, primarily because of new supply coming into the market. The second half market outlook will depend on Indian demand and the resolution of logistics challenges.', ""Now I'll talk more specifically about Mosaic and the very significant strategic steps we are taking. First, a bit of background. As Joel described, Mosaic is the world's largest combined potash and phosphates producer in the world and the most balanced with the 11.5 million tons of phosphate capacity annually and currently 10.7 million tons of annual potash capacity."", ""In phosphates we have the largest reserves in North America with about 35 years of remaining rock reserves in Florida, though I should note that we've been saying we have 35 years of reserves for as long as I've been here which is 10 years now improving processes, improving technologies, keep extending the useful and profitable life of our mines."", ""Our MicroEssentials premium phosphate product is a clear differentiator and we are growing our production capacity to about 4 million tons per year or nearly a third of our total phosphates capacity to meet fast-growing demand. Finally in phosphates, I'd note we have a logistical advantage in serving the North and South American markets and to India with our Saudi Arabian joint venture."", 'In potash we are the second largest North American producer with current operating capacity of 10.7 million metric tons and expansion projects underway that will increase our capacity to 13 million tons per year. In potash we have access to at least a century of very high quality ore.', ""I'd like to spend some detail on costs, some time going through detail on our costs, which are a paramount concern to us, especially when we are at the troughs of cycles. At Mosaic we view low cost production, low cost operations as a cross cycle priority and we are taking significant steps to improve our position."", ""First, let's look at phosphates as shown on this slide. Our Florida operations are in the lowest quartile of production costs in the industry and this includes the newly acquired CF Industries facilities. As we have discussed a number of times we have additional plans to take $200 million of cost out of this business unit over the next five years which we expect will offset inflationary pressure and will further enhance our very attractive position on the industry cost curve."", ""We have also taken important strategic steps to build the phosphate business and I will touch on that shortly. In potash the cost curve is much flatter across the industry and we are well positioned, especially so that we exclude the cost associated with brine management at Esterhazy. This chart shows cost on an FOB port basis. We have a much stronger position for product delivered to North America. In this business also we have plans to remove $200 million of cost over the next five years and I'll show you some data about how that will improve our cost curve position."", ""While we're talking about our expense reduction plans, I'd also like to note we recently unveiled plans to remove close to $100 million of cost in our corporate support functions over the next few years. We undertook an exhaustive review of our support functions, the activities they performed and we've developed plans that will allow us to appropriately serve our business units but to do so much more efficiently. Overall then we've committed to more than $0.5 billion of cost savings over the next five years and I know we have a meaningful amount of compensation tied to achieving those goals."", ""Now, as said, I'd like to dig deeper into our potash production costs where we see opportunity in the years ahead. While potash market fundamentals are stable, prices are still relatively low and it is likely we will not be producing anywhere near our top capacity for a few years. This chart shows 2013 actual MOP production with enterprise cash costs of about $140 per ton, and with Esterhazy, the world's largest potash mine, at the low end of our underground mine costs even with brine inflow costs."", ""The Belle Plaine mine shown here is a lower cost operation now because it is a solution mine whose cost depend heavily on the cost of natural gas. And like most market watchers, we expect natural gas prices to stay low for the foreseeable future. The smaller mines depicted here, Colonsay and Carlsbad, are higher costs primarily because they just don't have the capacity of Esterhazy. High volume production is obviously cheaper per ton."", ""Now let's look at this in a different way. As an example, if we optimize production across our mines, average enterprise cash cost would decline to the low $120 per ton. This means that if we simply maximize production at our lowest cost mines maintaining our current overall annual potash production, cost would decline. Note that this does not include the additional cost reduction programs that I discussed a moment ago."", ""Now here's the big potential shift. When our new K3 mine shaft is up and running, it's low cost production will give us the option at some point to reduce brine management expenses either in part or in total. We don't expect this scenario to play out until the next decade but if or when we make this decision, cash cost for the entire potash business would decline to below $100 per ton and Esterhazy cash cost would be below $80 per ton which would likely make this the lowest cost potash mine in the world."", 'In the near term when the K3 shaft is in operation, the potential impact of an uncontrolled brine inflow declines significantly. This in turn will allow Mosaic to evaluate and likely reduce our current annual brine management spending. As you can see we are adapting to potash industry realities. We are well positioned today and will be in great shape in the future and when fundamentals improve.', ""Now let's turn and look at the remarkable progress we're making on our strategic priorities. By now all of you who follow us know these priorities. We are delivering tangible gains as we execute our strategies related to people, growth, market access and innovation and we believe good execution on these priorities will drive shareholder value."", ""Consider this list of accomplishments for just the first few months of 2014. We closed the CF Industries phosphate acquisition, I'll cover more detail on that in the next slide. More recently we announced that we have agreed to acquire ADM's fertilizer distribution business in Brazil and Paraguay, and I'll also provide more detail on that in a couple of slides."", ""We have made significant progress on the financial front as well. We have repurchased or committed to repurchase about 12% of our outstanding shares and we are approaching our clearly articulated balance sheet targets. In addition, we have committed the necessary capital to expand production of MicroEssentials and we've made all this progress in operations while continually improving our safety performance, a critical priority for us. And as already noted, we continue our focus on enterprise wide cost savings."", ""We are well along the path of integrating the former CF Industries phosphate operations and we remain extremely pleased with this transaction. The two cultures are a great fit and the 700 CF employees that we have inherited are energized and highly engaged. As we announced on our last earnings call, note that we will have zero margin on finished product that comes from this acquisition per accounting rules. This impact will largely be confined to the second quarter. That said our appealing financial projections for this transaction have not changed. We expect meaningful synergies and accretion and we expect to complete our integration by the end of this year. And don't forget that we will enjoy the benefits of our related CF ammonia supply agreement beginning in 2017."", 'The ADM deal likewise holds great promise for our international distribution business. It allows us to cancel elements of our previously announced organic investment strategy and accelerate our growth in this large and fast-growing region of the world. We are targeting to close this deal around the end of this year. We expect to increase our market share in Brazil and we will have facilities in key strategic locations in that country as well as in Paraguay.', 'In addition, this deal will allow us to capture more of the significant incremental margin we derive from our MicroEssentials product line. As you may know, we capture roughly 20% of the incremental value of our MicroEssentials product with the other 60% going to farmers and 20% going to distributors. In Brazil, where we have our own distribution capabilities, we captured 40% of that value. The new MicroEssentials capacity expansion I described earlier and the ADM transaction will complement one another very nicely.', 'So now onto a few comments about our balance sheet and capital priorities. We have clear cut and consistent priorities for our cash. First, we will maintain our investment grade ratings and financial flexibility including a sizable liquidity buffer. Second, we will set aside the capital necessary to sustain our operating assets and our annual dividend. Next, we will invest in organic growth, pursue acquisitions and joint ventures and finally return excess cash to shareholders.', 'We have consistently generated strong operating cash flow including over $600 million in the challenging first quarter business environment. Our cash flow combined with our very strong financial foundation have enabled us to make major investments for growth while returning substantial sums of capital to our shareholders. We are well on our way to achieving our balance sheet targets by the middle of this year including our 1.5 to 2 times adjusted debt to EBITDA goal as shown on this slide.', ""Here's a more detailed look at recent capital commitments. One thing that I think has been somewhat overlooked recently is the number in the upper left hand corner of this chart. Nearly $9 billion in capital commitments have been made in the past two years all of them entirely consistent with the philosophies I mentioned and all of them fitting well within our ability to fund."", ""To put it succinctly we are making major investments, taking advantage of cyclical opportunities to drive value creation and returning excess cash to our shareholders. On the latter point, note that we have repurchased or committed to repurchase over 12% of our outstanding shares. We have a positive outlook for Mosaic's future and our actions will allow us to fully capitalize on that outlook."", ""In summary, here are our key messages. Mosaic is the largest combined P and K producer in the world. We ship product to customers in roughly 40 countries which gives us important geographic diversity. We have a very strong financial foundation with clearly articulated policies and priorities. During this challenging market environment we are making major strategic strides. The ADM and CF acquisitions and the ammonia supply agreement that accomplished the CF transaction, for example, and also the decisions to exit businesses that don't produce appropriate returns on capital such as our Hersey potash mine and our operations in Argentina and Chile."", ""Maybe most important our management team has been together for a long time, we've been through cycles, we don't get too excited in the up cycles, we don't get too down in the down cycles. We're very well prepared to thrive across the cycle and adapt to change. We believe in our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs and we're determined to become the leading crop nutrition company in the world."", ""Thanks for your attention.

It will be without question I believe when it is up and running in 2017 the lowest cost phosphate production operation in the world and we're thrilled to have a 25% stake in that operation as well as a 25% share of the output from that operation.

Beyond that we have a joint venture with Vale in Peru, the Miski Mayo mine which is an important supplementary source of rock, a nice edge onto our mines in Florida. There aren't any other joint ventures of particular note. We have sulfur supply, logistics supply chain agreements with Gulf Sulphur Services which is an important but probably not material joint venture. And I can't think of any other joint ventures – Anton, can you – that would be noteworthy at this point in time.

2881,Lawrence Stranghoener,"[""I'll take you through a bit of a history journey I think to help understand them. Mosaic was founded just about 10 years ago and at that time we were not ready for prime time, so to speak. We didn't have the right processes in place, the right systems in place. We didn't have the right people in the right places. We had too much debt and we needed to spend a lot of money to be a fully functional public company. We got a little bit of wind in our sales. That's about the two or three-year mark to the company had money to spend and we put in place more than adequate systems and processes and probably more people as well than we needed as we sought to overcome the significant weaknesses we had at the beginning. I think that as the years have gone by it's become clear especially as we need to adjust to realities in the potash industry that we didn't need quite as high a level of service from our corporate functions to our business units as we were providing. So we've taken the opportunity to look in great detail, painstaking detail at all of the activities we performed in our corporate support functions and came to the conclusion that we simply did not need nor could we afford to do everything we've been doing. And so every one of our support functions has been eliminating activities and therefore eliminating the people that are associated with those people some more than less. This is a very strategic thoughtful approach. This was not an across the board. Everybody shall cut 15%, but we think the end result will be a much more effective and efficient corporate support function, a set of corporate support functions that are aligned with the realities in this industry right now.""]",question_answer,MOS_68670
2882,Joel Jackson,"['So the next question is, are we at a normalized potash price or do you see any additional recovery and in what timeframe? And then what needs to happen for downside or upside to occur?']",question_answer,MOS_68670
2883,Lawrence Stranghoener,"[""I think we've hit a bottom in potash pricing. We've seen a bit of recovery off of that bottom. We think that because of very strong demand and that's really one of the key messages we'll be imparting during our one-on-one meetings today, the demand picture for potash is really quite strong. We think it will remain strong through the end of this year and further we think that has to happen to eat into the excess supply the industry now faces. I think as you know in commodity businesses, supply comes on in stair-step fashion, demand grows in a more linear fashion. Right now supply is ahead of demand, so as we look out in the second half of the year, we do see this strong demand growth beginning to eat into excess supply. We think that may pave the way for modestly improving prices as we head into the second half of the year. But all of that said there still is a supply/demand imbalance in favor of supply that's going to provide headwinds I'm afraid for pricing for some time to come in this industry. So off the bottom to be sure, room for some modest recovery because of very strong demand, but I don't think we're off to the races any time soon with respect to potash prices.""]",question_answer,MOS_68670
2884,Joel Jackson,"['Maybe following up on that, specifically in North America there is a lot of supply coming on from a lot of your partner/competitors. One of your customers, Agrium, is adding a lot of capacity this year – well, finishing it this year and bringing it on the next few years. How do you see sort of North America playing out with all the new capacity coming on?']",question_answer,MOS_68670
2885,Lawrence Stranghoener,"[""Yes, North America will be an interesting market over the next two or three years as Canpotex numbers add new capacity. I think most of you know that the primary outlet for export sales for Canpotex numbers is through Canpotex where allocations are controlled by production volumes. So any excess production capability almost necessarily has to find its way into the North American market and we'll see how this plays out over the next two or three years. I think it's likely that we'll see less room for imports in the North American market due to the factors you just addressed, Joel. So that's how we see that playing out.""]",question_answer,MOS_68670
2886,Joel Jackson,"['In your ADM acquisition this year, maybe talk about some of the – elaborate on some of the rationale for that in terms of pushing more MicroEssentials into Brazil, maybe being able to have more ability to move some of the incremental phosphate you picked up from the CF acquisition, maybe some other rationale too?']",question_answer,MOS_68670
2887,Lawrence Stranghoener,"[""Yes, Brazil needs to be understood. It's a different market where retail distribution is critically important. Brazil is a market of very large retail farmers. I was in Brazil just a few months ago, for example, I visited one 20,000 acre farm where the farmer actually had a 100 row planter, imagine that, a 100 row planter. So the scale of the farming there is unknown to North American farmers. So, as a result, the industry is different. The distributors co-ops don't play as meaningful a role. You need to be able to serve farmers directly and to do that you need blending and bagging facilities and you need access to ports. And so we've had that presence for some time in Brazil. We've got about a 12% or 13% share of the distribution market in Brazil that already provides an important element for our own products. We saw the opportunity to expand that distribution footprint. We had embarked on our own internal investment program to accomplish that. When the ADM acquisition came up it allowed us to accomplish just about everything we wanted to in one fell swoop in geographic areas that were very complemented to our own with facilities that are in great condition. So this is very much aligned with our strategy for market access for providing access to our products in Brazil and for enhancing the value of our MicroEssentials sales. I see that our time is up.

A condition exacerbated by shortage of locomotives and a congested system due to increasing grain and commodity volumes. As a result, our international volumes were low and we faced short-term containment issues in Canada.', 'We continue to see diversion trends at our two nutrients.

2892,Lawrence Stranghoener,"['Thank you, Jim, and good morning, all. This morning, I would like to cover four topics: first, our capital and balance sheet; second, the CF integration and our expectations for the acquisition; third, our financial results; and fourth, our guidance.', ""Let's start with the balance sheet. As Jim said, we have made great progress. As recently as last fall, investors were clamoring for us, to put our cash to use and eagerly awaiting the exploration of restrictions on our ability to repurchase shares."", ""As of today, through several transactions, we have repurchased 42.4 million shares at a total cost of $2 billion, and have agreements to repurchase an additional 9.3 million shares by the end of July of this year. It's worth repeating, in just four months, from the end of November 2013 to the end of March, we committed to repurchase 12% of the company's outstanding shares, and we've maintained our $1 per year dividend."", ""All the while, we have funded $1.4 billion to purchase CF Industries' phosphate business, we have begun funding our joint venture with Ma'aden, we committed $350 million to purchase ADM's Brazilian and Paraguay fertilizer business, we plan to spend over $1 billion for sustaining capital and opportunity investments in 2014, and we have set aside funds over $600 million to fulfill our asset retirement obligations."", ""In addition, we're crafting a much better capital structure. We have issued $2 billion in low interest long-term debt and plan to drawdown $800 million in term loans. My message is this, we told you, we would put our cash to use and create an efficient balance sheet, and we have done so, by both growing the business and returning capital to investors."", 'Let me remind you, our capital priorities are to maintain our ratings and financial flexibility, sustain our assets and our dividend, invest for organic growth, pursue external growth opportunities, and finally, return surplus capital to our shareholders.', 'We told you, we would hit our stated balance sheet and liquidity targets by mid 2014 and we believe we will. We expect our leverage ratio, adjusted debt to EBITDA to be well within the range we communicated to you last May, in the range of 1.5 to 2 to 1. Beyond 2014, subsequent capital returns will be a function of cash flow generation and available investment opportunities.', ""Now, I'll move on to the CF Industries' phosphate business integration, which as Jim said is proceeding according to plan. We welcomed about 700 new employees to Mosaic, and we are finding the cultural fit to be excellent. We share values and steadfast commitments to safety and environmental stewardship."", ""Jack and I just spent two days visiting our new operations and we're most impressed with the quality of the facilities and especially the quality and high engagement levels of our new employees. Going forward, of course, our phosphate guidance will include CF results. It's important to note that for the second quarter, our margin on tons from the former CF facilities is expected to be close to zero."", 'This is the result of acquisition accounting requirements mandating that inventory we purchased from CF is mark-to-market. This accounting rule has no impact on cash flows. We are on track to achieve or exceed the targets we have previously set for the acquisition and of course the EPS accretion is even greater, given we have repurchased shares since these targets were set.', ""Now, I'll move on to our financial results for the quarter. The year-over-year decline in market prices and the beginning resurgence of demand are reflected in our results. And since Jim already covered market prices and volume drivers, I will focus on expenses."", ""Comparisons to last year's first calendar quarter for both operating segments and the corporate segment were impacted by the change in our fiscal year, as our annual equity performance award expenses were recorded in the quarter ended March 31."", 'In addition, as Jim mentioned, we have programs in place to remove approximately $0.50 billion in costs across Mosaic over the next fiver years, and we plan to achieve that goal through operating efficiencies and labor savings.', 'To emphasize the importance of this, we have implemented a special equity incentive tied to achievement of aggressive goals. This non-cash expense related to this award was also recorded in the quarter.', 'Finally, we also recorded higher other operating expenses related to these cost initiatives. Specifically, we recorded $6 million in the first quarter in our potash segment for early retirement and severance cost.', 'In phosphates, we experienced strong demand and good price momentum. The year-over-year decline in gross margin dollars reflects lower finished product prices, partially offset by lower raw material cost. Our gross margin rate in the segment was lower than expected, primarily due to a longer than anticipated lag time between pricing and delivery of our premium products.', 'In potash, within our price and volume guidance ranges, despite the logistical challenges that impacted volumes, operating rate and gross margin rate, on a year-over-year basis, operating earnings declined to $166 million, down from $306 million. As you can clearly see from this slide, the lower sales prices had a significant effect on our earnings, only partially offset by higher sales volumes.', ""Finally, I'll cover our near-term outlook and guidance for the second quarter of 2014. Our outlook is positive. In the near-term, we expect modest margin expansion in phosphates and stable operating rates in potash."", 'In the latter half of the year, we expect continuing improvements in business conditions. Of course, many unknowns will influence the environment, including U.S. crop plantings and progress as well as demand from India and exports from China.', 'Global demand prospects continue to look positive, bolstered by strong rallies in a wide array of agricultural and livestock prices during the first quarter. We project that shipments of the main solid phosphate products will increase nearly 4% to a record 65.5 million tons this year. We have narrowed our forecast range from 64 million to 66 million tons, to 65 million to 66 million tons.', 'In the case of potash, we projected MLP shipments will rebound more than 7% to a record 57.4 million tons in 2014. We have also narrowed our forecast range from 57 million to 59 million tons to 57 million to 58 million tons. The slides in the appendix highlight the changes by region from our last forecast in February.', ""In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 3.1 million to 3.4 million tons for the second quarter compared to 2.9 million tons in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $430 to $460 per ton. Mosaic's phosphates' operating rate is expected to be in the mid-80% range during the second quarter."", 'The phosphate segment gross margin rate in the quarter is expected to be in the high-teens. The impact of the accounting requirement resulting in purchased finished goods inventory having no margin is expected to negatively impact gross margin by 3 percentage points.', 'In the second quarter, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.2 million to 2.5 million tons compared with actual volumes at 2.4 million tons in the same period of last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $250 to $275 per ton, including a higher proportion of exports than reflected in the first quarter.', 'The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the high 20% range. Our operating rate in potash during the second quarter is expected to improve to the mid-80% range. We expect to continue to ship as fast as logistically feasible.', 'Our 2014, Canadian resource taxes and royalties expectations remain in the range of $120 million to $180 million. Expectations for full year brine management expenses to continue to be around $200 million. Also for full year 2014, we estimate SG&A expenses to be approximately $400 million to $425 million, including cost savings initiatives and the impact of the CF phosphates business acquisition.', ""Other expenses, for which we don't historically provide guidance, will include severance and early retirement-related charges. As we did in the first quarter, we will include these as notable items as they occur."", 'For the year, we estimate an effective tax rate, excluding discrete items, continuing in the mid-to-high 20% range and capital expenditures and equity investments in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion, including investments in our Saudi joint venture.', 'With that, I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.']",management_discussion,MOS_67418
2893,James Prokopanko,"[""Thank you, Larry. We've seen a number of recent reports expressing weariness with the long-term fertilizer story. I think I get it. We talk in grandiose terms about the need for global food security, the ever-growing global population, the slow increase in new land dedicated to agriculture, and we talk about it all the time."", ""The reports I've seen, seem to imply we want to minimize the short-term challenges by diverting attention to long-term need. And I will concede, I think I've made the statement that we manage Mosaic for the long-term on just about every quarterly earnings call over the past few years. But the skeptic will say that the long term is like tomorrow, it never arrives."", ""I'd like to address the skeptics with a few thoughts. First, as we've said many times, this is a cyclical business with higher highs and higher lows, as we move through time. That presents opportunity for all of us. Opportunity for strong companies to invest in the troughs, as Mosaic has done through this period and opportunities for investors as the cycle turns."", 'The tendency we all have is to project current conditions on the long-term. To think that the present trends in global agriculture with commodity prices down will continue in perpetuity. History is not your friend, if you hold this view. Yes, agriculture is volatile, but its long trend is upward.', 'Second, the short-term past and future has been and will be far less dire than has been portrayed for global agriculture and for the fertilizer industry, specifically. We remain solidly profitable at the lower end of the cycle.', ""At Mosaic, we've generated consistently strong cash flows. We've used our balance sheet strength to make highly promising investments for the bright future ahead and we've returned significant capital to shareholders, all while generating good profits in tough times."", ""And a further note on the short term. Farm economics, which lie at the heart of our business proposition, remain compelling today, particularly with corn prices back around $5 a bushel. The drop in commodity prices has been much discussed and it has decreased farmers' revenues, but at least as it relates to our business, the affordability of crop nutrients remains very compelling for farmers."", 'That brings me back to the long-term. Listen, we tell the food story all the time, because we believe in it. Around, the world more people need to eat, more of them have the means to buy and consume protein and little additional land is being devoted to production agriculture.', ""And therein is the sweet spot for crop nutrition. Sustainable intensification is essential to feed the world, and fertilizer used correctly is the most important means to that end. So what we have here around the bottom of the cycle is Mosaic generating solid profits and making big investments to achieve the tremendous promises of future. That's our story. It's true and it's compelling."", ""One note, before we take your questions.

2928,Michael Rahm,"[""No, I think that's a good description, Jim. Just if you want to put some numbers to it, our 57.4 million tons of shipments this year compares to our capacity estimate in that 69 million ton to 70 million ton range. So we're looking at utilization rates for potash in the low-80% range. We think they're going to stay in that range over the next several years."", 'And I think the key question there is if you compare those rates to the really tight period when we think the industry is running at 95, how do you optimize production at those rates. And I think most of the potash players are working hard to try to optimize operating rates when you need to run at 82% to 85% rather than 95%.', 'And as Jim said, in phosphate, we see a fairly stable situation at moderately higher rates over the next two to three years, as the demand outlook there continues to look very good. Our shipment forecast for this year is up about 2.3 million tons. And every year we get 2 million tons of additional demand. That is going to stop up some of the additional capacity that comes on.', 'And as Jim said, the key feature of long-term phosphate outlook is the fact that we think the massive expansion program in China has come to an end and as demand continues to grow that growth is going to be met by new capacity coming from places like Saudi Arabia and Morocco.']",question_answer,MOS_67418

We see the U.S. industry continuing to be a very large stable industry, playing a very steady role in the global market where growth and demand will be met by some of the new entrance or new capacity coming from the Mid-East and North Africa.']",question_answer,MOS_67418

You said that you weren't sure that distribution was necessarily at the top of your core competency list, which is why you were moving carefully. So as you ramp up in Brazil, do you now have the expertise you need or do you still need to add people to take that business where you want to bring it?

Why Brazil, why are we so determined to expand our distribution. Well, you've seen what the history of increased imports into Brazil are. Ag continues to grow in Brazil at probably one of the fastest growing rates in the world. We think that's going to continue for some while."", ""Brazil is a very challenging country to get product from an offshore position into the farmer's hands. They've got challenging -- they have issues with logistics, they don't have a great rail system, they don't have a Mississippi flowing through the country, and having access into the direct farm markets or into the farming region is an important part of getting our product to the marketplace."", ""Having port access, which is just terribly congested in Brazil, having our own facilities, having control of our own facilities is important and the expansions that we've put in place, both our internal expansions in the ADM acquisition will allow us to get product and be assured of getting our product to the market. That's number one."", ""Number two. It is a hand in glove with our CF acquisition. We will be able to meet the increased demand that we're forecasting with CF tons. And to the third point, that we have the talent in management to execute on that. The expansion and addition of ADM is going to challenge us. We've got a leadership team that's been effective in the business that we have been operating at present. We know that we have some holes that we'll have to fill and augment and some new talent we have to bring in."", ""We've got this deal with ADM closing in the end of this 2014 calendar year and that gives us good time to plan for integration and ensuring that we have the right leadership team. I have got a background as Rick McLellan does in distribution and retail operations and we understand that the task at hand and we'll execute on that."", ""The other question is the operational excellence program, how is that different than our current cost reduction program that we have in place. We've been continually focusing on the cost side of our business. This one is a right-sizing effort that has a different approach than we've had in the past. We are looking at the next three and five-year forecast. We are right-sizing our business to what we think will be a stable operating rate both potash and phosphate."", ""And its 10-year since Mosaic was formed, it has allowed us to just better understand the business that goes without saying, but also we've established some tremendous functional support systems in place. We've put a newer ERP customer relationship management program, new HR systems. We didn't have these six and seven years ago. We've got them in place. We got them debug. We've got them operating."", ""So we're just much more effective at running our business and not spending as much time as putting new systems in and new processes in place. So I think we know where we can become more efficient. I think we've always been very effective, but now it's all about efficiency gains and harvesting all the investments we've made in better operating systems and better IT systems."", 'And third, we have some far better talent running the business, virtually every mine and chemical plant has a new leader in place over the last five years and some real talent has risen to the top. So we will see these improvements hit the bottomline.', ""And another difference is we've been very specific about and very detailed about where the savings are going to come from.

I'm not so sure that it was a plan to increase share as to increase our returns and our profitability in North America and that's what drives us. Market share, yes, it's an important, but it doesn't add to EPS by just having more market share if you can't do that with the greater gross margin."", ""And I'm going to have Rick talk to that. We've had a good quarter. Our program of exclusive space and supply contracts and early placement of potash, the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter served us well this year.

2936,Richard McLellan,"[""As we think about our programs into the North American market, our warehousing agreements are working just fine.

I think the surprise that everyone had in distribution is the fact of how serious this winters impact was on the rail systems and that's yet to play itself out, but we feel very good about those warehousing agreements."", ""The second question is one that we look at. And on the premium for prices versus international, I think that as you think about it, North America was always the highest price market in the world, Europe has passed that now, and both have something in common. They are granular markets that have distribution businesses that don't buy in vessel quantities. They buy in railcar and train quantities, some times truck."", ""And so the issue that we see there is there should a premium in North America from a logistic standpoint. And because there is imports coming to the center Gulf, the price reflected in North America when you back away the freight, net backs to those international producers at a price that's very much equal to delivered Brazil.

China has been growing, we've said a couple of times have grown their phosphate market and it's a real grab bag of quality. There is some very good quality and there is a lot of very poor quality, low nutrient content, lower than normal nutrient contents and a poor granularity in the product.

2944,Jim Prokopanko,"['Good morning all. Thank you for joining our fourth quarter 2013 earnings discussion. I will start by acknowledging the obvious; the external business environment impacted our results. Potash and phosphate prices were low. Although phosphate prices began to move upward in December, but our outlook is rosier. We are starting to see some rays of sunlight at the end of this tunnel and Mosaic is extremely well positioned for the day light to come.', 'We also were and are an excellent position to succeed through this prop of the cycle. Potash prices fell by approximately $130 per tonne during the calendar 2013 year and phosphate prices fell by $150 per tonne. Because of those steep declines, we generated $179 million in operating earnings during the quarter on sales of $2.2 billion.', 'For the calendar year we earned $1.1 billion or $9 billion in revenue and generated $2 billion in operating cash flow. Well these numbers fell short of a calendar 2012 results, our ability to generate meaningful earnings and operating cash flow in the trough of the cycle demonstrates the resilience we’ve built into our business model.', 'Strong volumes and reduced inventory drove operating cash flows in excess of $500 million for the quarter. In turn we invested $370 million. Clearly we managed Mosaic for the long-term. We want to deliver shareholder value across the cycle and we are positioning the company to do just that.', 'We believe the business cycle is beginning to turn in our favor. We said this many times over the past year and it is coming true, volume comes before price. That is to say, we expect to see shipping volumes increase before prices turn upward. As you can see in the presentation accompanying our discussion today, that exact scenario happened in phosphates. Prices hit bottom during the fourth quarter and volumes accelerated to record levels, which in turn moved DAP prices upward.', 'Coupled with lower year-over-year raw material costs, this all bodes well for margin improvement in phosphates in the coming quarters. In potash price have seem to found the bottom following the recent contracts with China and the beginning of upward price momentum in Brazil.', ""We need further demand increases to tighten the global supply and demand balance before we can expect significant price improvements. Now it's important for you to understand that we do not expect dramatic short-term potash price increases. The downward part of the cycle is prolonged and we expect the upward swing to take time as well. But we do expect better operating conditions in the second half of this year."", 'We have always known that our markets are cyclical and we’ve prepared Mosaic to succeed in the peaks, troughs, and everywhere in between. Difficult markets often present excellent opportunities and we have made rapid and important strategic progress over the past year and the pace of progress accelerated during our seven-month stub period.', 'I’d like to cover some of the highlights. We expect to close the CF Industries phosphate acquisition in the near future, pending additional regulatory approvals. The additional 1.8 million tonnes of phosphate capacity will bring our capacity to approximately 11.5 million tonnes ensuring Mosaic’s place as the largest Finnish phosphate producer in the world.', 'In potash, at our Esterhazy mine, we recently completed an extremely successful Canpotex proving run. In fact the run exceeded the expansions design capacity by 20%. Our potash expansions continued on budget and on schedule despite a rising cost environment, in Saskatchewan and challenging conditions in the global potash market. Our Esterhazy K3 mine shaft has reached a depth of more than 1,000 feet on its way to 3,600 foot level.', 'Our long-term ammonia supply agreement with CF Industries will allow us to purchase up to 725,000 tonnes annually for 15 years with pricing based on a formula tied to the prevailing price of U.S natural gas. The agreement will begin when CF completes its plant expansion in the Louisiana.', 'Along with our joint venture partners Ma’aden and SABIC, we broke ground last week on the new integrated phosphate complex in Saudi Arabia. The project remains on schedule and on budget, and when complete, we expected to be among the lowest cost phosphate facilities in the world.', 'Mosaic extended its product innovation lead. For the first year ever, we invoiced more than 1 million tonnes of MicroEssentials to customers in North America. We are streamlining our supply chain logistics on Tampa Bay with the construction of 110,000 tonne state-of-the-art warehouse facility and the purchase of ammonia handling assets. These were not large investments. But it demonstrates our commitment to continuous efficiency improvements and high standards of operational excellence. Also in phosphates, we made good progress in our Central Florida mine permitting process.', 'As you are all well aware, we made several important strategic financial moves. Today we announced that our Board of Directors has authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program in addition to the 43.3 million Class A shares we’ve already agreed to purchase. This reflects our commitment to optimizing our balance sheet and returning capital to our shareholders.', 'In December, we effectively put our split-off transaction behind us by reaching an agreement to repurchase 43.3 million shares of Class A stock from the Margaret A. Cargill Trusts. We’ve completed more than half of those repurchases which will continue through the middle of this year.', 'Also in November, we issued $2 billion of long-term debt at a very low average interest rate of approximately 5%, putting us insight of our stated leverage targets. And we reached agreement with our banks to significantly increase our revolving credit facility, allowing us to meet our stated liquidity targets.', 'We are committed to reaching the balance sheet targets we established last May, maintaining an investment grade rating and are confident we can generate cash flow to fund our investment agenda. And still more developments, we announced our intention to invest in additional distribution assets in Brazil, which is among the worlds most promising agricultural markets.', ""We're making good progress towards exiting our distribution business in Argentina and Chile, and decommissioning our small potash mine at Hersey, Michigan. Those elements of our business simply were not generating appropriate returns for our shareholders. We have also taken steps to ensure Mosaic will remain a low-cost operator."", 'As we outlined at our Analyst Day, in October, we’re working to reduce cost across the Company, in both business units and in our support functions. On another note, we held a successful grand opening for the Lodge at Streamsong last month and the resort is now fully up and operating. I must tell you it is a spectacular place.', 'Finally, and in my mind most important, we set yet another new record for safety performance in our seven-month stub period. We achieved a 13% improvement in our key safety measure on the heels of two consecutive record periods. That’s quite a list of accomplishments for seven months and all of it represents meaningful progress.', 'We are growing our business, securing our supply of raw materials, rationalizing our asset portfolio, creating a more efficient balance sheet and operating with excellence. We’ve a lot to do in 2014 to bring these accomplishments to their full potential. But while we’re engaged in the critical work of integration, expansion and cost reduction, we’re not taking our eye away from additional opportunities. We will continue to push our innovation lead, we will look for additional growth opportunities and we will continue to work to optimize our balance sheet.', 'Now, I’d like to ask Larry to address our financial results and our guidance. And then I will offer some concluding thoughts before we take your questions.']",management_discussion,MOS_63384
2945,Larry Stranghoener,"['Thank you, Jim, and good morning. I’d like to begin by discussing our balance sheet strength and then I will move on to our results and outlook. Even after executing all the strategic actions Jim described, we continue to believe we’ve substantial capital to return to our shareholders.', 'To date in 2014, we have repurchased 24.7 million shares for $1.1 billion. We have agreed to repurchase an additional 18.5 million shares between now and the end of July and as you saw by our announcement this morning our Board of Directors has authorized an additional $1 billion of share repurchases, which could be accomplished through either direct or open market repurchases.', 'We are planning to issue short duration debt to finance the CF acquisition and expect to do so at attractive borrowing rates. While we intend to repay that debt relatively quickly with cash from operations, it will add to the current $37 million per quarter debt related interest expense.', 'It’s important for you to understand that we will remain appropriately conservative in our approach to capital redeployment, paying close attention to our financial priorities as well as to changing external conditions.', 'Now, I will move on to our results for the quarter. First, until we complete the current Class A share repurchase process; we will report our earnings per share using a two class method. So even though the full 43.3 million Class A shares have already been taken out of our official outstanding share count, for modeling purposes the simplest approach is to assume those shares are outstanding until we actually close on the shares repurchased.', 'Second, we also had a significant discrete tax item that factored into our reported earnings for the quarter. As a result of a tax settlement between governments, we changed our intention to repatriate earnings from our Canadian operations, resulting in an approximately $100 million non-cash P&L charge. The decision will also modestly increase our 2014 tax rate, but it is not expected to impact our tax rate beyond 2014.', 'In phosphates, we sold a record 3.4 million tonnes of product clearly reflecting the volume before price pattern we expected. The heavy sales volume reduced our year-end inventories. Our gross margin rate in the segment was 12%, lower than in prior quarters primarily due to the decline in average realized prices and lower realized margins on crop nutrient blends sold through our international distribution business.', 'Raw material costs have declined and we expect that trend to carry into the first quarter, more on that in a minute. Our operating rate in phosphates for the quarter was down slightly to 81% due to scheduled annual maintenance turnarounds.', 'In Potash net sales increased compared with both the sequential and year-ago quarter as a result of both the late fall application season and the pent-up demand Jim mentioned. Prices declined further to an average MLP selling price of $303 per tonne. As a result, our gross margin rate for the segment decreased to 21%.', 'Our operating rate declined to 65% as ongoing production curtailments at Colonsay were partially offset by the highly successful Esterhazy proving run. Ammonia and sulfur prices declined during the quarter. Ammonia costs were $422 per tonne and sulfur prices were $123 per tonne, down from $486 and $167 per tonne, respectively, in the prior quarter.', 'On a year-over-year comparison basis while ammonia costs were lower, an extended maintenance turnaround at Faustina had a roughly $9 million negative impact on gross margin within the segment. Also, keep in mind that market prices for raw materials takes some time to be reflected in our cost of goods sold. Despite the recently increasingly raw material market prices, we expect to realize low sulfur and ammonia costs in the first quarter of 2014.', 'Now, I will turn to guidance. In phosphates sales volumes are expected to range from 2.3 million to 2.6 million tonnes for the first quarter compared with 2.7 million tonnes in the same period of 2013. We believe some of the record sales in the fourth quarter pulled volume from our first quarter and our inventories for new sales in the first quarter are mostly committed. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $390 to $420 per tonne. The gross margin rate for the phosphate segment is expected to increase to the upper teens as we see the benefits of higher prices and lower raw material costs.', ""Mosaic's phosphate operating rate is expected to be in the low 80% range during the first quarter. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.7 million tonnes much of which has already been committed. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $245 to $275 per tonne. Keep in mind our recent proving run of Esterhazy increased our Canpotex allocation to 42.5% and that is factored into the price and volume guidance."", 'Our gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to improve to around 30%. Our operating rate in potash during the first quarter is expected to be in the mid 80% range as we prepare for an expected strong spring season. For the full year 2014, brine management expenses are expected to be approximately $200 million and Canadian resource taxes and loyalties are expected to be in the range of $120 million to $180 million.', 'In addition, we expect full year SG&A expenses to range from $350 million to $400 million and an effective tax rate in the mid to high 20% range which includes the additional tax expenses I mentioned earlier. We expect capital expenditures for the year in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.3 billion.', ""Before I turn it back to Jim, I'd like to address our expense management initiatives which began years ago in phosphates through a program we call ROIC Works! and in potash through a program Momentum. We have consistently worked to lower costs and offset inflation. Our goal has always been to maintain or improve our low cost position and maximize free cash flows."", ""At our Analyst Day last fall, we showed you our plans to continue to maximize cash flows by cutting sustaining capital by $250 million per year and taking $200 million in annual costs out of each of our operating segments. Now, we've expanded our focus also actively engaged in reducing our corporate support function costs. We are committed to being a low cost producer of both nutrients across the business cycle."", ""With that, I'll turn the call back to Jim for his concluding remarks.""]",management_discussion,MOS_63384
2946,Jim Prokopanko,"[""Thank you, Larry. These are not the best of times in the crop nutrition industry but conditions are improving. During our last earnings call, I said that economics will win in the end and by that I meant that economic forces will outweigh temporary interventions in the market. That's proving to be true now as excess supply has been absorbed by strong demand leaving producers with limited phosphate inventories and lower potash inventories. We believe once again that economics will win and that prices will rise over time in response to more balance supply and demand dynamics."", 'That said, plenty of factors always influence the markets not the least of which is grain and oilseed prices. The record 2013 crop has sent the 2014 December U.S. corn futures to about $4.50 per bushel and it remains to be seen how that and the South American harvest will affect spring planting in the North America. Farmers still can make money at these grain prices, especially given the affordability of crop nutrients. Of course broader economic issues including the apparent slowing growth in emerging nations could impact global farmer behavior.', ""But longer term forces are undeniably in our favor. I talked frequently about population growth over 21st century and the compounding challenge it poses on global agriculture. But we can't ignore that the compounding has already begun. The challenge is upon us now. The United Nations estimates that to meet demand global food production must increase by 50% by 2030, that's just 16 years from now."", ""Consider that for a moment. By the time my new born granddaughter can drive legally in the U.S., we'll have to be producing 3 bushels for every 2 today and 6 hogs for every 4. Perhaps more arable land will come into production, but either way the existing farmland simply must produce more, a lot more and it must do so sustainably. And crop nutrition is absolutely essential to farmers' ability to meet this staggering challenge."", 'At Mosaic we have built a resilient business capable of prospering through cycles and we have seized many opportunities during this challenging time to strengthen our franchise for the decades ahead.

And so we feel that's in a good position and prices are going to move into the second quarter. And then to the look at the international markets, I think you just need to use Brazil as a proxy. We've seen prices increase in Brazil since the start of the year, up $40 a tonne. And part of that is that it's driven by market conditions in Brazil where carryout inventories were lower year-on-year and frankly the economics of soybean productions are very good.""]",question_answer,MOS_63384

So I think that boards well for sustaining the price increases that have been announced recently. And in the case of phosphate, I would just comment that we have seen this 40% run in prices since the end of November without any impact from India and we believe that India has an appetite for phosphate imports that’s 2 million tonnes greater this year than it was last year.

Couple of other things we’re watching is; what happens to grain and oilseed prices as we approach the spring planting season, that will have some impact in how the Brazilian oilseed crop develops from hereon is going to have an impact and much is yet to be played out. The other thing that we’re watching is the transportation. I have been in this business over 30 years. We’ve never not gotten our customers all the products they need. However this year has really been a real test with serious ice on the river in the U.S. with serious snows -- really, really serious snows in Western Canada. We’re facing transportation issues and backlogs unlike we ever have before. The frigid, frigid temperatures have reduced the railways shipping, there instead of shipping 100 car, 120 car trains they’re limited to 50 car trains, trains are getting stuck in the snow and dealers and buyers are starting to get tuned into that story. If we have an early spring, snow goes away, no flooding, we’ll get the product there in time. But right now we’re struggling to keep up on the logistic side with the demand we have. So a couple of big question marks hanging over the market going into the spring season.

So we see a 4 million tonne increase in global potash shipments in 2014, and that’s made up of the following. We think China we’ll see 800,000 tonne increase in shipments there that is made up of about 500,000 tonne increase in net imports coupled with about a 300,000 tonne increase in their domestic production. If you add to China, about 200,000 tonne increases in Malaysia and Indonesia that gives you the first million tonnes. We expect India will import a million tonnes more potash this year than a year ago. And then, we also have about a million tonne increase in the former Soviet Union, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. And there we see greater use for NPK compound production that is going to be sold to domestic and offshore customers as well as greater demand for direct application use particularly in the Eastern European countries and the former Soviet Union. And then we have about 500,000 tonne increase expected in Brazil in terms of their overall shipments. And then the other half million tonnes comes from the rest of the world including North America, other Central American countries and so forth.

2971,Rick McLellan,"[""Yes, there's a lot to your question, Ben. I'll try and cover it all. But first of the question is where are we at with subsidies. The expectation that we get from our Indian customers is that we will hear something about subsidies earlier than we have in the past, but it will get itself dealt with probably within the next 60 days which would be earlier than what we've seen. So that's the one thing. We think that will be behind us within the next 60 days. Then when you talk about phosphates on the swing, last year India imported about 3.5 million tonnes of phosphates and when you take a look at it, that probably is the low point because as Jim said what gets missed is there was 1.5 million to 2 million tonnes of pipeline inventory in pace close to the farmer that frankly hadn't been counted. So to have the same deliveries to farmers they've had last year, their demand is going to be in the 5.5 million tonne range we believe and frankly that could be higher depending on what happens in the marketplace. We're really at a point right now with phosphates where farmers are seeing what's happening in global markets and their returns are very good. Potash is a bit of similar situation. We saw their imports drop to just around 3 million tonnes. We believe there's 1 million tonnes more could be imported this year as pipeline inventories have been drawn down. So frankly we see the back half of the year the opportunity for India to come in and probably move more volumes than they have in the past.

2978,Mike Rahm,"[""Good morning, Don. Thanks for the question. Just in terms of how much of the increase in shipments is the result of the pipeline drawdown, that's a tough number, but I would say that there probably is a good 2 million to 2.5 million tonnes when you take a look at the potential pipeline drawdown that we've seen in the past. In terms of the other components of your question, we're projecting around 58 million tonnes of shipments this year relative to our capacity estimate that's in that probably 65 million to 66 million tonne range in terms of effective capacity. I think what's important there is the Brownfield capacity that has come on is in the hands of major producers, so we don't see that operating rate as something that raises a bunch of the other red flags in terms of price impact. And as I said earlier, when we look our projected supply and demand balance getting into the second half of the year, we see the market coming into a much better balance the second half than what we've seen for the past couple of years as you know by following North American inventories we've chugged about 3 million tonnes of inventories for quite a while and we see that getting pulled down to normal or average levels in the second half of the year.""]",question_answer,MOS_63384

2981,Jim Prokopanko,"[""Good morning, PJ. I'll let Mike talk about those inventories. That's a top question given the state of reporting of inventories. On your question has there been a demand response or supply response from competition, the North African producers are struggling with some serious, serious North Atlantic storms. There has been some delays in shipping. There's about 20 vessels waiting and it probably is going to be until the end of April before – so sometime in April before the backlog is going to clear. There is – some of the shippers are just having a hard time with the swells at the port facilities. So we've seen supplies unnaturally pinched in the last couple of weeks. People are producing at a high level of production. I've seen some Eastern European producers report 100% production levels. So I'd say the worldwide industry is already production at very near back to whole capacity and it's going to be hard to accelerate that production rate. And maybe with one of the North African producers coming back into the market that's about the best of it, but we have a tight S&D balance rate now as it is. So the response is people are shipping and producing as much as they possibly can and I'd say the world is coming up a bit short. Mike, do you want to touch on the – can you touch on the worldwide P&P inventories?""]",question_answer,MOS_63384
2982,Mike Rahm,"[""Sure. Good morning, PJ. I think we highlighted this in our last issue of Market Mosaic which we titled Picking Up the Knife. These markets have been in a bear run for two years and if you – during that period of time, you would expect that all distributors are going to minimize the amount of inventory that they carry and we think that certainly has happened. And I think the poster child for that is India and we provided our analysis at an outlook presentation we made at the TFI conference in November as well as the AgCollege presentation that we made in January and I think both of those presentations are available that we go through and highlight the drawdown that we think has occurred in India. And in that case we think wholesale and retail inventories in India have been drawn down to about 2.5 million tonnes over the past year. And while the drawdown hasn't been as dramatic in other parts of the world. I think that the trend is correct, that everyone is trying to maintain very lean inventories and once you get a trigger where people then believe that the bottom is in. What's happened is that we had to rush to the market, and we’ve had several other factors that have exacerbated it and you typically don’t see 40% run in prices like we’ve seen in phosphate due to one factor. I think it's been a combination of things. On one hand end user demand remains very good while add commodity prices are off from their highs last year. They still generate some very good on-farm returns. So end user demand is good. The pipeline we think is very lean. We have talked about some of the increases in raw material cost, the logistical challenges and then I think to sprinkle on top of that just the queens of impact of several planned or unplanned production outages and you have the ingredients for a very, very strong run and I guess I just reiterated what Jim said is that fundamentals in the phosphate market are extremely tight due to the combination of all those factors.""]",question_answer,MOS_63384

Since 2008 where global financial prices occurred, people had a real lesson in risk management and Mike said that, dealers and pipelines have gotten accustomed to dealing and are demanding that they have been there pipelines all the time and less inventory with price risk. Result is, we got this greater volatility that we had when people aren’t buying it, it's applied to a declining market and maybe rapidly so and we test new bottoms. Yet when demand comes and we’re convinced that demand will be choppy but steadily growing over time, but you’re going to see these spikes and they’re going to be somewhat unanticipated when you -- the storm in North Africa all of a sudden one of the major producers is having trouble shipping to Latin America and North America, it happens over night.

Is it really just generated internally or would you be significantly increasing your debt to target ratios? Thank you.""]",question_answer,MOS_63384
3003,Larry Stranghoener,"[""Yonah, it's Larry. Everything that we're talking about doing on the strategic initiative front on the shareholder capital return front is very much in line with what we laid out last year with respect to our capital management philosophy. At that time we talked about a debt to EBITDA target of 1.5 times with the willingness to go to 2 times for a strategic deal such as the CF acquisition. We talked about maintaining a very strong liquidity buffer and we talked about our commitment to investment grade credit ratings. And given the large cash balance we have accumulated given the prospects for the business, we believe that we're able to accomplish all of what we've outlined today within the bounds of those balance sheet targets."", ""So with that, Jim, I'll turn it over to you for concluding comments.""]",question_answer,MOS_63384

I've asked those folks to please call Laura and Anton [ph] directly and they'll promptly follow-up with you."", ""With that, I'll conclude our call by reiterating our key messages. First, market dynamics are unfolding just as we expected they would with sales volumes preceding price improvements. We've seen a big increase in phosphate prices in response to tightening supply and we expect strong demand for potash to lead to improving prices later in the year."", 'Second, Mosaic has made remarkable strategic progress. We are growing, securing our supply and raw materials, optimizing our business portfolio and creating a much more efficient balance sheet. As a result, Mosaic is in excellent position to thrive as we emerge from this low point in the cycle. Thank you all for joining us today and please have a great day.']",question_answer,MOS_63384

3006,Joc O’Rourke,"['Okay. Thanks PJ. Everybody can hear fine I will take it. We are going to stick more or less close to this podium but I may move across a little bit. So what I’d like to do today and relatively casual form give you real concepts of the proposition that Mosaic uniquely brings to the market.', ""We believe that crop nutrients is an exceptional business and we believe within that Mosaic is an exceptional franchise. So we’ve built a really strong franchise, we have built this to be strong not just in the good times, but across the cycle. Throughout the cycle this is a company we believe is positioned to do well. And we're going to talk a little bit about how we're leveraging the times today to expand our business."", ""And then the last thing just want to cover for you is we believe the long term outlook of agriculture is great. Yes, we're in a little bit of a dip right now, but long term, this is an industry that we think is going to perform very well."", ""So, I carry on forward the first thing of course is the Safe Harbor. I will be making forward-looking statements, you can read that, I'm pleased to, some other time."", ""So, first of all who is Mosaic? Well, we're the largest combined producer of phosphate and potash in the world. We shift the customers in over 40 countries and that gives us a real geographically diverse customer base and allows us to adapt to some of the things in the market. A good example would be India with the subsidy programs, because we have such a diverse customer base, we can adapt to that."", ""We have a very strong balance sheet, I think everybody is aware of that. I'll talk about that a little more, when we talk about use of capital. Certainly we're optimizing our asset portfolio in first and things of that. I can go back through that, but to just make sure and everybody is very aware of our share repurchase ambition. We have the financial might or the financial ability to access a lot and repurchase a very significant number of our shares, we announced that we're planning to do that and we're taking a step towards that. Again I'll go through that in time."", 'And the last thing just to note is an experienced management team. We have been through this before as a management team, we’ve been through the cycles, we’ve been through the ups, we’ve been through the downs and we have a record of executing on what we would say we do. And that’s probably the one thing I want to highlight. If there is anything I can tell you the take away from this, if you look back at our history, you look back at our presentations, you look back at everything we have said, we have done exactly what we’ve said. So we’ve never left anything to surprise you and I think that’s something important with Mosaic.', 'So let’s start talking about who we are, our mission is to help the world grow the food it needs. Singularly we believe that is a noble mission but it’s also a good business premise because feeding in the world is going to be larger and larger challenge overtime. So who are we then within that? In phosphate we are the largest finished phosphate producer in the world. We have the largest reserves of the phosphate producers in North America with over 35 years of phosphate reserves. We have introduced the most innovative phosphate product, our MicroEssentials line which has been an extremely good market product and I will talk a little bit more about that, but it’s one of the basic foundations of how we believe we can grow our phosphate business. And we are logistically advantaged because of our location in Florida through the Americas, but two other markets as well but particularly we’re logistically advantaged through the Americas in our phosphate business.', 'Potash business, second largest potash business in North America over 100 years of reserves, well positioned cost wise also well positioned from a logistics to North America and our relationship with Canpotex for the rest of the world. So two great businesses, two great positions and something we are really proud of.', 'So let me start up talking about the first of all potash. Well, largely in the quantity business costs are pretty much everything as we think go forward. In potash we are somewhat in the middle of the cost curve, but saying that it’s a very flat cost curve. And a lot of people are aware, we pay probably a $30 a ton [bogie] because of our Esterhazy brand inflow issue. If you put that away, our cost would certainly be down in the first or second quartile. And as we develop our potash business, first of all we have expanded it, so we have expanded it judiciously.', 'You may have heard a year ago, we actually delayed the expansion of Belle Plaine and Colonsay the second phase is about because we did see this market slowing down. So we have been very judicious about our use of capital, but we are expanding that business, at this stage, we have just finished the expansion of Esterhazy and that’s ongoing, but also we are building that we call K3 which is a full new shaft for our Esterhazy mine, the biggest potash mine in the world, we are building a whole new shaft which once completed will isolate our brand inflow area and allow us to reduce that cost definitely taking us down into that first or second quartile. So we really see a great opportunity in potash for Mosaic and in the long term, we see this as a great business for Mosaic.', 'The other business of course very important to us is our phosphate business. In the phosphate business we are in the bottom quartile. We are the largest finished phosphate producer in the world as I said. And our rock force is 90% Florida, but there is a diversification in that, we bring rock from Miski Mayo which is a joint venture we entered a couple of years ago in Peru. We bring in rock from Morocco, et cetera. And now as our investment in Saudi Arabia will be bringing our finished products from Saudi Arabia to our market.', 'So we really diversified our phosphate business. And with the acquisition in CF. CF I am going to talk a little bit on more about the acquisition of CF phosphate business, but with the acquisition of CF phosphate business, we’re also going to optimize a lot of our capital and operating strategy around Florida. So this is, we’re really, we have a lot of faith in the phosphate business long term and we’re investing to execute against that.', 'So I mentioned earlier, our premium products, particularly our MicroEssentials lines and this has been a fabulous story for Mosaic and I think it gets, as much at our play as I would like to see is obviously the operations person, but what you see here is a product that was essentially 400,000 tons a year in 2009, now represents 10% of the U.S. phosphate fertilizer market. It represents 25% of Mosaic sales at this time.', 'We have built 2.3 million tons of capacity, metric tons of capacity and we are planning for more. As you can see here, calendar year, ‘13, ‘14 we’re going to pump that up again to a point where we believe it could be as much as 40% of Mosaic products we might be selling as MicroEssentials. And the MicroEssentials story is important what we have found is by building a molecule that has the micronutrients of sulfur and the phosphate all in one place means a distribution to the plant root has been a lot more effective, which gives you better yield, better value for the farmer, better value for the dealer and of course better value for Mosaic.', ""So this is a higher margin better value product that we're very proud of. And I think, I just want to highlight that it's going to make a difference in the phosphate market overtime. And I think it already is, but it's going to make a big difference in the phosphate market overtime. And we're seeing the same footprint and we're seeing same response in Brazil. So North America and Brazil, we're really seeing market penetration of this product and a great product."", ""In January, we're actually going to introduce another product, a potash-based micro nutrient enhanced product. And that product, we believe a first real innovation in the potash market in probably 40 years, we hope to change the way people look at potash as well. So, this is a great story, it's an area where Mosaic has been able to do its innovative nature so it's actually changed the market."", 'I talked earlier about our diversified customer base and I think this is another important aspect of Mosaic that differentiates us. We have distribution capabilities into the countries like Brazil, which are key markets for us. We have deep penetration into North America, which is the other great market for us. So we also have penetration and distribution in China, India and others through our international distribution, where we get not only do we get market, but we get insights into those markets.', 'So, we really get to understand what those markets are doing, we have insight information with people on the ground who really understand the market, they understand the people, they understand the customers. So, I think this really differentiates Mosaic and you can see while we are definitely a North American centric based with Latin America being the other key thing you just can’t ignore the fact that we sell 25% of our products throughout Asia and that’s phosphate and potash. So it’s not just Canpotex, our own international distribution sold a lot of our products outside of the Americas.', 'And how do we do this, clearly our secure distributions. And here is if you look at this, this is really our I am just going to come out here because our production base is certainly North America, but we have a great -- because we have the Brazil distribution we have a great access to Brazil, Canpotex has a great access to Asia as well as Mosaic phosphate we can pull which is what was [the outcome] we can also pull into Asia very well as a company. And we have that boots on the ground type access that we don’t believe anybody else does.', 'So let’s talk now a little bit about the -- so that was Mosaic and how we fit in it. So let’s talk a little bit more about the secular trends. We really are hanging off the believe that as the world population grows and no one I don’t think indenting that world population won’t grow and it might have slowed down slightly, but the other thing that is happening is world wealth is increasing so there is an expanding middle class in those countries, the BRIC countries, whether it would be Brazil, Russia, India or China, but those countries are where the growth is. There are also where the growth of wealth is. So we believe that’s trend is going to continue.', 'And if you look at the graph on the left you can really see world grain oil seed use, I mean it just hasn’t changed in terms of the pass up or it’s been 20 years. Yes, the market for fertilizer goes up and down, but in that, the overall underlying needs of food continue. And we believe that over the next 40 years, we are going to have to basically come up with another equivalent of Canada, I think it’s Canada, Argentina and UK or something of new productions. Just in these world demands. And so you will start looking at these things and you go well, the only way we are going to do that is through better for life. 60% of the crop productivity today is accounted for by the use of what we call chemical fertilizers. So the reality is as this business goes forward, this is absolutely needed.', 'Excuse me, the other aspect of this is, we are hearing a lot about this right now which is, well farm economic might be going down a bit. Well, that’s probably, the farm economic has been phenomenal for the last five years, so even if they go down a little bit the other thing we got to look at here is not only revenue per bushel, what you are really asking yourself is revenue per acre. And while the revenue per bushel might have gone down slightly, the productivity per acre and farm has been so much higher that there is a continuous improvement in the economic for farming, particularly in western countries and that.', 'And the key to that goal from our perspective goal is also while the price of crops is going down so is the price of input. And you can see, if you look at the graph on the left again I don’t know if I have to point at all, walk over again, but if you look at the graph on the left this is our chief economist, Mike Ron, Dr. Mike Ron this is, but it’s an affordability index for fertilizers. And you can see there is unprecedented in a lot number of years affordability for our fertilizers. So it’s just at least on a demand side, we’re in really good shape as we go forward.', 'Here we go. So what is going to happen overtime as we see it. The demand picture, we are pretty confident, it’s going to go up, it’s going to go up fairly steadily. Certainly potash demand has probably not grown up as quick as we have predicted five years ago, but again if you believe the underlying food story, you know that sooner or later that has to be picked. India is going to have to come up with better subsidy program, Asia is going to continue to use more, China has got the get -- they are going to buy in sweets maybe but ultimately they got to buy, because we got to feed a lot of people in this world.', 'And so what do we speak, the issue we see is not so much the demand side, that one fix with population everything else, the question on both sides is probably supply. And in potash what we are seeing is yes, there is probably a bit of an oversupply. I think there was a rush out of the gate by people to build capacity for the ‘08 or the ‘07 for ‘10 area, where there was an undersupply. But we do see that tailing off and demand catching up to that fairly, quickly and we see an operating rate in the mid 80s which is not a bad operating rate for this industry.', ""In phosphate, we believe it’s much more compelling sure, there has been few more tons come in through [OCP] and through [Sally] but we've seen a very steady rise in demand and we see a much more balanced market, where we still see ourselves in the high 80s or even 90s in terms of our running rate. And clearly, when we're running in the 90% range, the market is doing well. But the bottom line that means we've got a reasonably tight market and we're doing well."", ""So, now let's talk about the very specific thing to Mosaic which is getting on to our financial strategy and what not. Let's first of all just go back to our strategy originally. Our strategy originally was based on basically five pillars, if you will, people; innovation; market access; and growth, all leading to higher shareholder value. So the basics are, if we do the first four right, the shareholder value will follow. And we’ve talked about a few of these. Market access, we continue to focus on getting into these new geographies. We've announced programs to enhance our distribution capabilities in Brazil et cetera. So we're really focused on getting there."", ""In terms of growth, we've made some big moves recently, and I'll talk a little more in detail on those. But clearly our investment in Saudi was Ma'aden, is an example of us pushing for growth. Our product expansions are coming to a close, but we've really pushed that; and then the CF industry investment, which is another area where we're growing in high quality, high return assets that we can do."", ""Innovation and things like MicroEssential and the potash product are good examples. But the one that we don't talk about in innovation that Mosaic has done, if things like co-generation of electricity. We've added millions of dollars of value, and I where millions like $10 million, $20 million, $30 million a year of value, by just having our people being more innovative about how they use power down in Florida and how we co-generate power. We are going to start up another co-generation at our big New Wales plant. And it’s going to add about $30 million a year of value to us by allowing us to not buy power from the grid."", 'So these are the innovations, we don’t talk about as much. People think of innovation, they only think of product innovations, but we’ve done some huge things on productivity. And if you’ve seen our presentations and other things, you will see our mining costs in Florida have been flat for five years, flat to declining for five years, even against the back drop of a close down, our best lowest cost mine was closed down for almost a year and half because of a permit issue. And in all that time by being very innovative and working on productivity, our teams have been able to improve the cost per ton. These are fantastic things.', 'And then people obviously; we believe the big differentiator for Mosaic is those people. It’s the people who drive the businesses, it’s the people who drive the value, come up with the ideas; they are the ones that make a big difference to our company. Altogether what does that add up to? We believe that adds up to real shareholder value.', 'Now, the other aspect of shareholder value, and I will talk about that a little bit is, we are also looking at a portfolio. There was some big announcements recently. But if you go back to October when we did our Investors Day, back then we said look, we are going to start looking very hard at our cost, our assets and all this, and you say that we haven’t for the last five years. But in that -- in the meantime since then, we have announced that we are shutting our Hersey operation from a potash perspective selling [sales] operation, selling our southern column business which is Argentina and Chile, while same time buying CF and cancelling our ammonia deal, so a number of things to rebalance our portfolio in a responsible way.', 'And I want to highlight that; rebalancing our portfolio in a responsible way. We are not going to read (inaudible). And if the questions come up later today about what we are doing about cost, I will tell you that same answer, we are not going to need just the cost, we are going to do the responsible way for the long term of Mosaic.', 'So let’s talk about cash used. And I know you guys that you’ve heard one presentation from Larry or 100 presentations from Larry, we have never changed our priorities on cash used. So, I just want to maintain those or go through those again though. First priority for us is we said we would maintain investment grade. That is our first priority. We are going to have the cash reserve to manage through the good times and the bad times and we are never going to get ourselves caught out, or certainly as far as never did ourselves caught out. So, that’s the first thing.', 'The next thing is sustaining our assets. We believe long term value will be added to the shareholders by maintaining those assets in a good way. They will perform better for us, they will perform less expensively for us. So, we are going to maintain those assets, and maintain our dividend. Now again, important thing, so you’re your dividend and we’ve increased our dividend a lot, we are going to maintain that. And those are first two priorities. The next priority is to drive the organic growth, the organic being the (inaudible) expansion, the first (inaudible) expansions et cetera. But those are our next priorities.', 'The next opportunity is the strategic investment. And we believe right now is a good time to make those strategic investments. We believe right now is a good time to do CF; we believe right now was a good time to investment with the Saudis in Saudi Arabia. So, and then the last one is to return money to the shareholders. And in that we have been absolutely consistent. We said way back when the shares became available we would start negotiating with the Trust, the Cargill Trust. We are in the process of negotiating with those trusts. If the opportunity comes up, we will buy as many of those Class A shares as we can. But in any transaction, you have to have a buyer but you also have to have a seller.', ""So if the seller does not want to sell all or most of those shares, we will go to the open market to buy share. We will restructure our balance sheet by the middle of next year as Larry has said, been saying for the last year. So I know everybody likes to see it happen on November 26th, but there are steps in there we have to take and we just got to that point now. We are in that, we’ve taken out, you will see we took our $2 billion worth of bond debt. We've restructured for our -- it’s our liquidity buffer, we are ready for the next step. And we are executing that. And it will come in its time, and we will keep you up-to-date as that comes. So, I just want to point out that that's there."", ""The next offset of us is again going back to the long term, we will have a need for a sustaining capital; we will have a need for organic growth. But we've really been good about saying okay now, we've done this push, we should see that capital for coming down. So as you look at our estimate going down, going forward, we definitely will go down. We have some big investments though. The Ma'aden joint venture will be likely $1 billion or close to a $1 billion of spending overall."", ""We have some supply chain in international. We said we’re going to continue to expand our international footprint. But overall, now that we're through the big potash expansion, CF, sorry -- expansion of the CF. On the other side, we've canceled the ammonia project. So overall, CF has been negated by that. And I'm going to talk about that now."", ""So, let's just talk quickly on CF. We think CF was a really good strategic deal. And again I'm going to walk down; wasn't my intention to walk down here but I just wanted to point out, when we did the deal with CF industries for the phosphate, we called the project, project doughnut. And I'm going to tell you why. This is CF, this is Mosaic; it really was the whole in the doughnut for us. I mean it couldn't have been more sustained to call this project doughnut. And what we're going to see and the reason this is still compelling for us is the next big development for Mosaic is the Ona mine, which is right down here."", ""South Pasture is here and I think we should see Four Corners over here. And I'm not going to try and giving you a mining lesson but I want to point that out, because one of the big synergies here is we're going to expand the South Pasture mine. Our intention is to expand the South Pasture mine and put a remote mining area in Ona, so we won't have to put -- we'll have to put a $0.5 billion in to do the South Pasture expansion but we won't have to the 1 billion to do the Ona mine."", ""So, in that we're saving $500 million in our go forward strategy by having access to the South Pasture plant. The other thing is our Four Corners, believe not pointed out our Four Corners on the West is to the Four Corners mine now connects as part of the Ona as well. So between those two, we're going to greatly reduce capital."", ""But the other thing is we're going to greatly improve our operating cost because of the synergies that come from all of that just being so, approximate to each other. So, great thing there. The other aspect of it is you know this came with an ammonia offtake agreement out of Louisiana out of their Donaldsonville, which we believe is a great deal for both of us. It’s a natural gas based contract, it saves us to be cost of building $1.1 billion of ammonia plant and at least them in nitrogen which they are good at and it puts us in phosphate which we are good at. But net-net take a 1 billion out for the nitrogen plant; we were talking about building, 0.5 billion of direct capital synergies at Ona. Our capital spend going forward, now the timing is slightly different but exactly the same as what we would have done if we hadn’t done CF. And this is going to give us $30 plus million of EBITDA increment a year."", 'So, we think this is a great deal -- sorry, $0.30 a share, my apologies. I think $230 million of EBITDA and $0.30 a share, my apologies for -- I just want to make EBITDA has been right, very good payback, we did the other way. So look, CF good deal, I think a good deal. And one of those rare occasions where I believe it was a good deal for both parties; I think it was good for CF and I think it was good for Mosaic. So that it’s not every deal you can say that about.', 'So last, let me just conclude. In a capital intensive cyclical business, creating value is all about really being looking at long-term capital allocation, long-term cost, long-term market access. Those are really the key things we’ve got to do. We believe Mosaic is spending their efforts doing those things and doing those spends with the long view. And I can’t emphasize that enough is that if you take a short view in this business, I don’t think you are going to be a successful long-term, because you really have to be looking out (inaudible) there.', 'We are addressing the things we can control. It’s cyclical, so what are we doing, we said this at our Investor Day in October, we will say it again. We can’t control the market, but we can control a lot of what -- how we fit in the market, and we are doing that. And then finally, Mosaic is uniquely positioned to take advantage of this cycle and to take advantage of the long term agricultural trend.', 'So we believe we are in a great place, we believe agriculture is a great place to be. And within agriculture certainly crop nutrient is the best or certainly one of the best places to be. And we are right in the middle of it, so great company, great long-term future. Thank you.']",management_discussion,MOS_61477

It will only go up if we see an opportunity that really has mediated the company. So in other words, it will be an investment. If the sustaining capital is not going to change, our investment in expansion of our market business isn’t going to change. So that's all pretty set. Clearly we've delayed the Belle Plaine project if the market really changed in potash, might make sense to look at that again.

3010,Joc O’Rourke,"['The curve itself or our position on it? Well, it’s been our belief and we can’t speak for the rest of the world, but it’s our belief that the eastern block countries will be under more cost pressure over time. They do have an advantage in terms of labor cost and what not right now, but if the growth of those countries is good then there will be a -- their cost will go up as well. Conversely, we believe the North American producers and not just ourselves but all the North American producers, as we go up to the utilization because of our expansion will be more efficient, but particularly Mosaic, we will be quite a bit more efficient. So, there will be a transferring of the cost curve slightly towards the North American I believe over time.', ""But again, these cost curves -- one thing you got to put in perspective of potash is the cost of getting it out of the ground is X, the cost of getting it to that market is probably two-thirds to 80% of that. So in other words, it's very market specific. We are a lot more competitive in North America than we are in say well in Europe or we're just not competitive in Europe.

3027,Jim Prokopanko,"[""Good morning. Thank you for joining our earnings discussion for the third quarter of 2013. We have a lot to talk about today. So let's get right to it."", 'First, as you are all aware, the external business environment was very challenging during the quarter and that is clearly reflected in our results. We operate in a capital intensive cyclical industry where prudent capital allocation is critical to competitive success. While troughs are a part of every cyclical industry, these periods provide significant opportunities for companies like Mosaic, companies with strong balance sheets and the ability to execute an effective strategy.', 'Our earnings reflect the difficult operating environment but it is worth noting that Mosaic was still able to generate operating earnings of $144 million on revenue of $1.9 billion. These results include $142 million or $0.22 per share in negative notable items. These are largely non-cash, and they are primarily the results of strategic decisions that I will discuss in more detail.', 'We have built a highly resilient business and we continue to manage the company for the long-term as our results and actions this quarter demonstrate. The current market conditions do not change the long-term outlook for Mosaic or our strategy. We are focused on building reliable long-term sources of cash flow and we are succeeding at that in both business units.', 'In phosphates, our Saudi joint venture is progressing well and we are reinforcing our advantage cost position. In potash, our expenses remain on budget and on schedule and we are in the process of demonstrating the capacity of Esterhazy K2. Our innovation lead continues to grow with the launch early next year of our new potash premium product, joining the strong performance over MicroEssentials product.', ""We have also made major strategic strides in the past few months, further positioning Mosaic to achieve its vision of being the world's leading crop nutrition company. Last week, as you know, we announced that we reached an agreement to acquire CF Industries' phosphate business for $1.2 billion plus $200 million for their asset retirement escrow."", ""We also reached a long-term agreement for CF to supply Mosaic with a substantial portion of the ammonia we need to manufacture phosphate products. These deals make perfect sense for Mosaic and for our shareholders. Because of the proximity of CF's South Pasture mine to Mosaic's planned Ona mine, we will no longer need to build a full beneficiation plan at Ona, which would have been a $1 billion investment."", 'The ammonia deal, allowed us to forego a proposed ammonia plant in Louisiana, which would have cost $1.1 billion. Most important, after the transaction closes, we will have increased phosphate capacity to help meet growing global demand and capture substantial and highly probable operating synergies.', ""We recently reached two additional strategic decisions. First, we intend to sell our assets in Argentina and Chile and exit our distribution business there. Our business model simply did not match with the markets' demands, which is primarily a barter market and our profitability was not sufficient to justify continued investment."", 'Our South America strategy is focused on Brazil, where the future of agriculture remained very bright. Second, we are in the process of decommissioning our small potash mine in Hersey, Michigan, where we are facing significant capital outlays for potash reserve development and where we are preparing to sell it as a salt production mine.', 'Together, these two decisions and the cancellation of the ammonia project resulted in pre-tax charges of $123 million, which was largely non-cash in the results we reported today. All of these actions fit perfectly with the strategy and streamline our operations, and we expect all the will contribute to greater shareholder value in the years ahead.', 'Now, I will return to the current markets. Prices for both, potash and phosphate slipped lower, driven by a number of factors, including to name a few, the weak shipments into India and China and late harvest in North America, all of these factors are leading to very cautious hand-to-mouth customer buying decisions.', 'We have always said that economics will win in the end and we believe that continues to be true. The current situation is primarily driven by good oil supply and demand. Supply is increasing and shipments are temporarily soft. We expect these conditions to persist into 2014, but over time, we expect demand will return.', ""The world's farmers simply cannot grow their yields and their profitability without our products. As I said earlier, this is a cyclical business, but the long-term trend is solidly upwards."", ""The 2013 crop is likely to come in as the biggest ever and farmers are prospering and that's very good news for global food security. Even so, even with the largest crop the world has ever produced, yields must grow substantially from here to meet future demand."", 'Simply extrapolating the trend from the last 30 years, demonstrates the need for significantly higher yields, and of course, more fertilizer application. Farmers continue to reap large profits with their large crops even with moderating grain and oilseed prices.', 'Revenue and profit per acre matter to farmers. Crop nutrients are extremely affordable they are helping drive strong yields, which in turn drives compelling farm profitability. Over time, economic fundamentals will be in our favor. The outlook for the rest of the decade for potash supply and demand looks balanced, even as new capacity comes online and we expect operating rates to rise to the mid-80% range.', 'For phosphate, the long-term supply and demand equation is positive and we expect to operate at high rates in that business over the coming decade. In fact, if you look at phosphate demand, it is difficult not to notice the continued steady growth. A trend that bodes well for our two recently announced investments. Overall, the quarter was challenging, but we see brighter days ahead.', 'Now, I would like to ask Larry to provide more context on this quarter. Larry?']",management_discussion,MOS_59541
3028,Larry Stranghoener,"['Thank you, Jim. Given the complex nature of our results, I would like to spend some time helping you understand our performance and then I will provide our guidance for the fourth quarter. Our earnings reflect market realities as well as the largely non-cash negative notable items of $142 million in this quarter including the $123 million in charges Jim mentioned which reflect important strategic choices we have made.', ""Market set prices for our products but we can control our cost. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $94 million during the quarter, down from $115 million last year. This decrease was driven by lower incentive compensation and benefits combined with the end of costs associated with last year's corporate systems initiatives."", 'One item that likely has drawn your attention is our negative cash flow for the quarter. Timing worked against us this year. In the month of June, the first month of our seven months stub year, cash from operations was $434 million, so our year-to-date cash flow from operations for the stub trade was strongly positive and is expected to more than double by the end of the year.', 'We anticipate improvement in domestic demand, now that the North American harvest is winding down and farmers are focusing on fall applications, and this will draw down inventories. While we do not expect any meaningful short term price appreciation, the expected reduction in working capital should result in a more normalized operating cash flow situation in the fourth quarter.', 'Moving on to the segments. In potash, net sales were down significantly, as a result of lower realized prices and lower sales volumes, primarily to North America, both driven by factors I just described. Note that operating earnings for this segment included the charge for the exit of the Hersey, Michigan potash mine. We produced two million tons of product during the quarter, building inventory as a result of the ongoing Esterhazy K2 proving run, which is nearing completion. Our Colonsay mine remained idle during the quarter.', ""In the phosphates segment, net sales, margins and earnings were down due to lower prices and volumes as the phosphate business experienced a spillover effect from potash. Buyers of crop nutrients generally got significantly more cautious. Lower finished phosphate pricing was only partially offset by lower raw material prices, which I will address shortly. This segment's operating earnings also reflect two charges, the exit from the Southern column of South America and discontinuation of the ammonia project."", 'Normally there is roughly a quarter lag between market prices of raw materials and prices we realize in our cost of goods sold. This quarter, however, we have lower sales volumes and as a result, a much longer lag. Much of the benefit from lower raw materials prices went into finished goods inventory. We expect cost of goods sold to decrease offsetting further phosphate price declines as we work through this higher cost inventory during the fourth quarter.', 'In fact, we anticipate ammonium and sulfur prices realized in our cost of goods sold to decline to $405 and $120 per ton respectively in our fourth quarter. Our results in both segments highlight both the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business and the necessity of maintaining low-cost operations. As we discussed at our Analyst Day presentation last month, we are well positioned on the cost curves in both potash and phosphate and we are working to further reduce costs.', 'Now a few notes on capital deployment. First, we do not expect the CF phosphate acquisition to have an impact on our ability to repurchase shares, whether from the MAC trusts or in the open market. We continue to look forward to late November after which our repurchase restrictions will be lifted. We also intend to take advantage of some of our additional debt capacity in the near future. We were restricted from issuing bonds while we were in material negotiations regarding the CF transaction. Now that we have announced the transaction and will file a current 10-Q, we expect to conduct an offering soon assuming market conditions remain favorable.', 'Now, I will turn to guidance for the fourth quarter of 2013. We expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.5 tons to 1.9 million tons compared with actual volumes of 1.4 million tons in the same period of last year.', 'We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $285 to $310 per ton. The gross margin rate for the Potash segment is expected to be in the mid-20% range. Our operating rate in potash during the fourth quarter is expected to be below 65%, with planned Esterhazy maintenance after successful completion of a proving run.', 'Brine management expenses are expected to be in the range of $45 million to $55 million for the quarter and Canadian resource taxes and royalties are expected to be in the range of $40 million to $60 million.', ""In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.5 million tons to 2.9 million tons for the fourth quarter, compared to 2.8 million tons in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $370 to $400 per ton. The gross margin rate for the Phosphate segment is expected to be about flat with the third quarter."", ""Mosaic's phosphate operating rate is expected to be approximately 80% during the fourth quarter. Also, for the fourth quarter, we estimate SG&A expenses will be approximately $90 million to $105 million. For the seven-month stub period, we estimate an effective tax rate continuing in the high teens percent range and capital expenditures and investments in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion."", 'With that, I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding remarks.']",management_discussion,MOS_59541
3029,Jim Prokopanko,"['Thank you, Larry. Clearly, our markets are challenging part of the cycle. As we have stated many times, we know our business is cyclical and we plan for the trough, so that we can take advantage of the opportunities they present.', 'At Mosaic, we are addressing the things we can control and our strategy is working as our very important strategic progress over the past few months makes clear. At our Investor event last month, we reinforce our commitments to reducing sustaining capital and operating expenses and improving our position on the global cost curves.', 'Our approved potash expansions are on track with work progressing at our Esterhazy K3 shaft, which will give us significant optionality in the future. Earlier this year, we proactively delayed our additional brownfield expansions and Belle Plaine and Colonsay due to higher capital costs.', ""In the past six months, we have announced the investment in a joint venture in Saudi Arabia, the purchase of CF Industries' phosphate business and an the expansion of our footprint in Brazil, all to position us to capitalize on the very favorable long-term fundamentals."", 'Today, we have discussed additional strategic decisions, which along with our plans to return excess capital to our shareholders, are designed to optimize returns on our invested capital and generate shareholder value over the long-term. We have build an adaptable company designed to succeed in the dips, accelerate in the peaks and find opportunities throughout the cycle. Our results demonstrate that we can do just that. We are well positioned to succeed now and to amplify our success when not if markets improve.', 'Regardless of the markets, you should expect more of the same from us, steady, prudent management and a willingness to seize opportunities, all with the continual commitment to generate solid returns for shareholders.', ""Mosaic's future is bright both, because of our strategic progress and because of the remarkable opportunities ahead. Our future is tied to the greatest challenge of our time, a challenge that will increase for generations ahead feeding this growing planet. The world has to grow more food, a whole lot more food and it simply cannot do so without good crop nutrition. Therein lies the value of Mosaic, an excellent franchise built to withstand the troughs and prosper throughout the cycle supported by compelling future demand story.

In our reports and our study of the market is that the farmer consumption isn't down to the same level that shipments are down. We think the Indian farmers are applying good rates to both potash and phosphate and we are seeing pipeline, stocks drawdown, so with the recovery and eventual and I think within 12 months, we will see a recovery in China and India.

When we look at India, Jim talked about it a bit. We believe that while imports have declined on DAP to near 4 million tons this year, channel inventories at retail distribution have been drawn down at as part of applications have been solid, so this would frankly imply that we will see imports into India next year at 6 million tons to 6.5 million tons of DAP, which is part of what we expect the growth to be in the market.

At Esterhazy, we are nearing the completion of our proving run and we expect that we will demonstrate a capacity consistent with our already declared annual increased capacity. So that's going very well. But what it has meant is, we have had to run an operation, a little harder than we would normally run or a lot harder than we would normally run, particularly in this market. So it's meant, we have added inventory, at the same time we have had Colonsay shutdown for two months which has tried to mitigate it, but we are still increasing inventory."", 'With that, I am going to hand it over to Rick to talk about the demand side and how we are going to deal with that.']",question_answer,MOS_59541

The high-end of our range is the expectation that there will be some tons go to both India and China. And at the low end of the range is mother nature working against us in North America. So right now, we are very comfortable with the ranges we have provided and we think the market, frankly as we look at what our inventories will be at the end of the year, it will give us that flexibility to respond when the pipelines are drawn down and the market begins to move.

Good afternoon everybody and on the half of my colleagues, senior leadership team and our colleagues at Mosaic, thank you for joining us today here in New York at this outstanding venue for our Investor Conference. What the program is going to look like today is this; I am going to speak to some of Mosaic’s strengths & strategy. Then I’ll have some my Mosaic’s colleagues join me. We are going to have Joc O’Rourke, our COO of Operations and he’ll discuss our plans for Mosaic’s operations going forward.', 'After that, Rick McLellan, Head of our Commercial Operations; and Floris Bielders, Head of International Operations will discuss elements of our commercial strategy and our commercial side of our business. Then we will have Larry Stranghoener, CFO, who is going to discuss our financial implications of our strategies and our capital management priorities. And then I will finally conclude at the end with a few brief comments. We will take a short 10 minute break; then we’ll come back we’ll be set up for questions and we will have a Q&A question following that.', 'Well here today, I would like to talk to you about Mosaic, our strategy and how we’re going about executing it. I am going to talk about market and external factors to provide a backdrop of both kind of environment we’re working in and we’re going to talk about our operating environment which is important to understand, but that is not the focus of our presentation today. Our story at Mosaic has not changed. We are in exceptionally strong position to thrive and outperform competitors now and in the years ahead. We’re going to discuss things that set Mosaic apart from its competitors and give you a sense of how these differentiators inform our strategy and how we decide what’s next for our Company.', 'But first I’m going to give you a sense of the uniquely powerful portfolio of assets that we have at Mosaic. We have the slides moving along [Anton?]. There we go. Assets that we have and you could see from this map are strategically positioned all around the world, but concentrated in the key geographies that have the greatest opportunity for food production and agricultural growth. This through a unique mix of production, logistics and distribution assets that we produce 20 million tones of potash and phosphate fertilizer per year and ship that product to over 40 different countries into every major agricultural economy in the world.', 'You can see from the map that we have a major presence in North America with our production facilities P&K and distribution facilities as well as in Brazil where we have an extensive distribution network. You’re going to get more [indiscernible] about the advantages provided by this network and by these assets. Now expect many of you have visited either our Florida phosphate operations or Saskatchewan potash operations. And if you haven’t, you absolutely have to make the trip out there to see the extent and the size and scale of our phosphate operations and to take the opportunity to go 3600 feet underground and experience the potash operation. That has to be on everybody’s bucket list, let’s see on the room today.', 'It is hard to understand the scale and the scope of the resources and the machinery that we operate to produce the fertilizer we produce. It is easy to just think while that’s simple comes in a ship, you’ve got these little granules get supplied to the fields. But when you go all the way back to see what’s involved in producing the product, it is remarkable. For example, that bucket you see on the dragline over here, that bucket can hold two full size SUVs together. That arm is holding that bucket up to give that, to put that in to perspective that’s about a football field in length, a tremendous piece of equipment. Think about that into conjunction with the rest of the side, it’s a huge mining property, this machine swinging back and forth, extracting phosphate ore from the orbits.', 'The scale extends to our plant facilities, our production capacity, the logistics capabilities, the shipping capabilities, production storage, land and mineral rights. The point is, this business is expensive to get into and there are long term investments for anyone that they think they want to expand this in the industry. The hurdles are daunting. In Florida, we own over 250,000 acres of phosphate land, 12 times the size of Manhattan. And so they were in the process of pursuing permits for three more additional mines Ona, DeSoto, and the Wingate east.', 'With these permits and once we receive them well along on these well advanced, we will have 30 to 40 years of phosphate rock mining reserves in Florida and those years were likely expand.', ""I will tell you why. We have been seeing for the last decade we have 30 years to 40 years of proven and probable reserves and every year we reprove that we have another 30 years or 40 years. As mining technology improves, we’re finding more efficient ways to mine the rock and finding areas that we previously thought the ore quality was too poor to mine, we're finding we're able to apply the new technologies to mine these zones more profitably with greater returns to our business. Also we have production facilities in Louisiana on the Mississippi river. We produced the finished product, we bring in the phosphor rock to granulated at that site, the advantage of that is on the Mississippi and it’s a straight shot by barges up to Mississippi and to the mid-west, very well positioned to serve farmers in Central U.S."", ""Now this is a very important slide, you're going to see the cost curve and that’s going to be a theme going through today's program. This shows you the cost to produce phosphates compared with other competitors around the world. The curve looks at prices fob Tampa and show we're amongst the lowest cost phosphate producers in the world. Joc's going to go into more detail in his presentation. And I want to know that we're very much cost focused and you will hear that over and over again. In a large commodity industry, whatever kind of commodity it is, with natural cyclicality that you see particularly in agriculture, low cost producers strive and they are the ones that are going to succeed and we're committed to being that low cost producer in the world."", ""We have similar asset advantages in our potash operations. We have extensive mineral rights in Saskatchewan; we have centuries’ worth of potash. They are highly productive zones and low cost mines, some of the lowest cost in the world. Similarly with potash, it's not cheap to develop or expand a new facility, new potash capacity requires significant financial strength and not only do you have to have the financial resources, you have to have a belief in the long term outlook for potash and global agriculture. At Mosaic we have both; demonstrating those strengths those strengths with ongoing potash expansions and you will hear more about our expansions in Joc's presentation."", 'This gives a closer look at our potash operations in North America. The vast majority of our production occurs in Saskatchewan. We have a very small operation in Hersey, Michigan and one in Carlsbad, New Mexico.', ""Saskatchewan is home for the world's largest potash deposits. We're located in the center of North America which presents some export shipping challenges. About one-half of the potash we produce is sold in North America, so that's rail or maybe barged to the various markets. The other half has to be exported by vessel abroad, where 1,500 miles high water mostly Vancouver where our product leaves the country."", 'One of the reasons Canpotex, the potash marketing and export association the three Canadian potash members they belong to, allows us to pull our resources and ship efficiently than if each member of Canpotex had its own assets, if we had our own warehouses in the West Coast, if we had our own fleet of rail cars, if we had our own fleet of ocean vessels, it would be much more expensive to ship up products than it is today. So the efficiencies and the logistics are extraordinary with the Canpotex organization. And from Floris you are going to hear more details on how we go to market with product both in North America and overseas.', 'At this point I want to address a misperception about Mosaic being a high cost potash producer. That simply is not true and this cost curve speaks to that.', ""We looked at production on an apples-to-apples basis, and two themes become clear. First the cost curve is relatively flat. Aside from a few on the right side of this chart, 6%, 7% of potash production is high cost. There is no big advantage from any one company to the other company when you look at the low end of that cost curve. And second, Mosaic is very competitive especially if you discount our Esterhazy brine management cost marked blue on the chart. And many of you think you know, what are you doing exporting brine management cost as part of your cost structure? Oh yes indeed that's true. But even with Brine costs, Esterhazy is a highly cost effective mine, one of the lowest cost producing mines in the world and the largest mine in world. And with the expansions that we presently have underway, we have some important production optionality and that too Joc can tell you of the advantages once we get K3 shot some operation with some of the alternatives than we face some terms of consolidating mining operations."", 'I’m not going to spend a lot of time on talking about distribution but it’s worth pointing out. It’s an important part of Mosaic’s advantage in that we have a global reach that there is no other company that has the kind of distribution network available to it. In particular, exports to the world’s most important agriculture geographies include China. Recently it’s been somewhat unpredictable, we can’t tell when we’re going to come back in the market particularly through our potash products; they are an exporter of phosphates.', 'But in case of potash we still deliver a significant amount of our potash productions to China through Canpotex. And while Mosaic maintains a small cost effective infrastructure to facilitate distribution within parts of China.', 'India is the other major consumer of both potash and phosphate products. They should be a bigger consumer than they are or they have been these last 18-24 months. Current government fertilizer programs, subsidy programs and have restored the market standards to the farmers. Farmers are favoring putting night vision on over phosphate and potash. That is simply bad science, bad agronomics, and we’ve seen the soil quality, the yields start to plateau, the yields are plateauing, and wheat production and the salt quality is diminishing. After decades of crop progress, we have seen India reduce the amount of grains they’re producing or at least flat line.', 'We expect India will solve the problem; there is an election coming up next year and some period after that they will address the bad agronomics and we’ll see India return as a major consumer of both potash and phosphates in the world.', 'As you see, we have a limited infrastructure; we have employees about 300 employees in India. We have a small office in Gurgaon, just outside the Delhi and an important import facility in [Rosy] on the Northwest coast. This enables us to bring in product into an offshore unloading facility onto barges into the port onto trucks; then we can reach every part of India’s agricultural growing regions.', 'Now a more pleasant part is Brazil, it’s a different story, a much better story in terms of fertilize or crop nutrition production. Ag business in Brazil is growing rapidly. Deal record, if not a record year this past year, 30 million tons of fertilizer imports. We have more land coming into production and that land and the land that’s being farmed is being ever more productive in terms of its yields. We expect this growth to continue and we’ve been investing and continue investing in distribution network in Brazil.', 'Floris is going to talk about some of our plans. Our plans we’ve announced earlier. We’re going to invest about $300 million over the next several years to enhance and expand our distribution capabilities into this important Ag region of the world.', 'In addition to our high quality assets that I’ve been talking about, Mosaic has the talent and capabilities to (ripe) long term value from these assets and these previous ore reserves that we have.', 'Innovation has been one of those important elements in that strategy. It’s an important differentiator to Mosaic amongst all of the competing companies. Rick’s going to discuss product innovation, our past, how we got to where we are with the present hopes and some other future ideas on product innovation. This has been a major success story for us and somewhat underappreciated by the investors. Demand for MicroEssentials or phosphate products that’s either, contain sulfur or zinc has been growing rapidly. With Nexfos, our phosphate animal feed products is gaining market share. All premium products that we produce and these are K-Mag, MicroEssentials, Nexfos, Pegasus get stronger margins than commodity map gap in potash because they meet a customer need. They bring value to farmers, farmers are prepared to pay more for it, dealers see the value and that brings farmers, they’re prepared to pay more for the product.', 'Rick McLellan will give you some details on our strategy and I was thinking allowing the integrated products that we’re producing. And it’s just not product innovation, its process innovation, very important to us. It helps us save money. It helps us deliver better shareholder returns and it helps us maintain our social license to operate in the market that we run the chemical plants in the mines.', 'Give you couple of examples; in fiscal 2013, at one of our facilities, the staff found ways to reduce water consumption and water use. That water reduction allowed us to avoid making a $50 million reverse, investment in a $50 million reverse osmosis plan. Through small capital spending, I mean only a couple of hundred thousand dollars, these employees were able to reduce the amount of water consumed from 1,200 gallons per ton of finished phosphate products to 800 gallons per ton of finished phosphate products; a 25% reduction in water utilization with some tweaking and just some care to water use. I have little doubt, I have the challenge for the group to get down to 600 gallons per finished ton of phosphate, and apply that across our entire organization.', 'We’ve also derived much of the power we need for phosphate in the phosphate operations in Florida which was extensive power needs and we’ve done it through capturing waste heat that’s produced in puration of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, exothermic reactions we capture that waste heat, run generators. And it’s allowed us in the past year to save 1 million tons of CO2 emissions in 2013 alone, and it resulted in a major reduction in our electric bill. Within three to four years, we’ll be completely off the grid in Florida, generating all our own power.', 'You may not spend much time, some of you do, it’s not a common discussion was investor meetings but about sustainability measures. They’re important, we think about them a lot, that’s a big part of our operational discussions.', 'Land recommendation in Florida is a good example where we do recover the land and those of you that have I’ve seen reclaimed phosphate mines, it’s impressive, it looks, it is much improved over what it started at even before we started mining. These are impacted lands old (saturated), old pastures and when you see it reclaimed, put back to its natural state, it’s impressive.', ""We’ve relocated threatening species from these lands and bring them back to where we, before mining we’ll bring them back to where they were after we finish the mining. And we’re committed to community investments. And most notably I think of certainly the golfers in the room, you've heard of our signature investment in resort conference at a complex in central Florida, on one of our mines Streamsong Resorts, getting tremendous acclaim for the quality of its two golf courses. And this is being recognized in the communities we operate in the state of Florida. People really do value having Mosaic as a commercial corporate member. Our reputation is good as a corporate citizen in Florida and in Saskatchewan and contributes to maintaining our operate-to license in these two industries, mining and chemical processing that does have an impact in the environment and in the communities. Another of our strengths is a proven execution excellence. Got a few examples; safety is paramount at Mosaic. We want all our employees to go home safely at the end of every workday. In 2012, Mosaic set a new safety performance in a couple of metrics. In 2013, we surpassed that yet again; we take it very seriously, all employees at Mosaic have a financial compensation well related to the safety performance of the entire organization. Our board, our leadership take it very, very seriously. In South Port Meade we got a mine back into production, one of the largest, our single largest phosphate production mine and one of the lowest cost producing mines on a delivered cost to our facilities, I think the lowest cost producing mine in the world."", ""We’ve made major progress on our products expansions, 3 million tons of expanded capacity, going to cost about $3 billion, we're on budget, we're on time, despite being in a very highly inflationary area market in Saskatchewan, our energy products projects, potash projects and basic materials development in that industry. It's been tough to keep a handle on the capital costs."", ""We've entered a JV with the Ma'aden company, phase 2 of their phosphate expansion plans, 3 million ton mine and phosphate production facility in Saudi Arabia. Mosaic will have 25% of the equity in that company. We're going to contribute to the technical knowledge and the engineering knowledge to build a facility and Mosaic importantly will have a 25% uptake agreement for that product. So that's going to put us in a position to serve the Indian, the Southeast Asian markets as well it's going to give us a product that going to amongst the lowest cost manufactured phosphate in the world; just a great position, great investment to be part of."", 'The Esterhazy mine, this past year, set production records, all time production records that our teams are very proud of. And we had another solid increase in the sales of MicroEssentials at Mosaic.', ""Our financial foundation is another important source of strength, and differentiates Mosaic versus our competitors. We’ve communicated our capital intentions several times. Most recently in May we talked about our financial philosophy, and Larry is going to delve into considerable more detail little later in the program. What I want to remind you about is that our surplus cash, a significant debt capacity, give us meaningful flexibility to return capital shareholders, Larry's going to talk about that in some detail, and our investing for growth and funding the obligations we have whether it's dividends or our bankers and to our suppliers, we are into great, great financial strength. The other thing that some investors talk about and not many do is about our company's cultures and values."", ""At Mosaic we spend a lot of time on that, that does and as chief executive that does really set the foundation for the company that you're building. It's an important part of what Mosaic does if we want to become truly a world class organization. Our mission and we've left everybody with the mission statement values and vision for the company. Our mission at Mosaic and all employees understand it and really get it, is to help the world grow the food it needs, this is a daunting and humbling task when you really think down to the essence of what it means, it means people getting fed in the world that otherwise might not able to get fed. And we can only make this kind of big contribution in the world that they need from us is if we achieve our vision, and that is to be the world's leading crop nutrition company and internally we have a number of metrics that tell if we are the leading in our judgment top nutrition company. And if we operate with continued and we will get this accomplished if we operate with continuous commitment to our values, and you see them listed - integrity, excellence, sustainability and connectivity. And that top one integrity with all we here, happening in the world and certain other sectors of the world, integrity is a big deal and when you talk to our customers today, our potash customers, they respect the Canadian producers, they respect Canpotex with the integrity about which we go and do our business."", ""So we're quite proud of our company, the one we built, we do look at external comparisons, we do look at benchmarking to understand, are we as good as we think we are, so we've looked at and considered various awards in the world. We've got a couple here that we're going to profile, we got an external recognition for many of these values and priorities that we have at Mosaic, I am just going to play a short video highlighting some of these accomplishments."", 'Anton, can you run that?', '[Audio-visual presentation]', 'We all take a lot of pride in having those awards and again it’s just not to have the badge or the trophy in the cabinet in the entry, it’s to get the external validation that yes we are good, we are amongst the best in the world at what we do and compared to all the other industries that go for these awards, it was really heartening to see that we are being selected for them.', 'So that’s our view of what sets us apart; the most powerful combination of assets, our extensive global reach and some of the best talent and financial strength in the crop nutrition industry. Those strengths have informed our strategy and how we go forward that enables us to generate long term shareholder value by having these things behind us.', 'Now what does it mean in terms of that strategy. Every four or five years we take a deep dive factory strategic analysis and we bring in external facilitators to help keep us on track. We use Mckenzie, we use BCG for these efforts, and we’ve done two now. We just completed on a year ago and about four years before that we did our first one. And it has really helped guide us and help us decide and keep on track for the next four or five years. This last month I would share with you the five priorities that we’ve established in that strategic review. And I am going to say as we did this review we considered other ways to run this business, other industries, other sectors, and we looked very broadly, we look to draw the fuse around the world. What we determined was, that there is no business sector better than agriculture for the decades ahead. So we decided we are going to stick in agriculture. And within agriculture we looked in extensive range of business alternative from seed companies, to irrigation companies, to chemical companies, equipment manufacturing, mining of the materials and what we have decided crop nutrition was the sweet spot that’s where we wanted to stay, staying in the center of the fairway as they say potassium phosphate. Now, what of the priorities we are going to have executing on that strategy. First is the people, this industry has similar cost curves, similar all, similar technologies, and it’s hard to differentiate yourselves. And what I found to relieve the effect at differentiating ourselves is with the people we have. And we have assembled a team at Mosaic that I believe is the best in the world at the crop nutrition sector and in the sector for that matter. We have a group of noticing the other people. And I think that recognized in much of the industry and at least with the people we serve. We intend to maintain this critical competitive advantage going forward by attracting, retaining and developing these highly talented people. So whether it’s training programs or recruiting programs, or thoughtfully designed retention programs, we really do take as a first priority having noticeably better people in our organization.', 'The second priority is growth. Potash expansions are a good example of what we’ve been doing. It will significantly increase our operational capacity by 30% up to over 13 million tons of finished potash production. And over the long term our Saudi joint venture enables us to further diversify our sources of phosphate rock, finished phosphate products and provide us access to key markets around the world with logistics advantages. And we’re going to continue to look for value adding businesses, development opportunities that might be any place in the world both joint ventures and through acquisition.', 'Third priority is market access talked about that a little bit. We’re constantly working to secure our existing market access and that’s one of the developments that is emerging in the coming clear to us. Having access to critical markets in the world those agricultural regions is becoming ever more important. Having ways to get into those markets, having port access, having people that understand those markets; that’s more important than it was five years ago and certainly more important than it was 10 years ago. But we’re increasing presence in the key agricultural regions. You heard about Brazil, you’ll hear more about it. It’s one of the very few regions Brazil is in the world where new farm makers is being brought into production. We intent to invest as I said $300 million in a number of projects to expand both our import and distribution capacities in those countries, and in Brazil.', 'Fourth priority is innovation; not something you hear a lot of in the crop nutrition business. There aren’t a lot of new crop nutrition products coming down the line. There is nitrogen, phosphate and potash. All elements on the periodic table but we are looking at those from a different perspective and saying how can we augment them, how can we bring more value through potash and phosphate to our customers. MicroEssentials, our phosphate innovative product, reached 11% market share in North America. Over one in 10 acres of phosphate that’s being applied or blend that’s being applied with phosphate is a MicroEssentials’ product. Seven years ago that was nothing. So in 10 years to be where we are now and that growth has happened in the last couple of years, in particular, and is gaining traction in other regions of the world. We’ll continue to deliver product technologies that improve yields and help farmers take care of the environment as they do their important work of farming.', 'And finally, as always at Mosaic, we take shareholder value very seriously. We’ve made it a strategic priority. It wasn’t a strategic priority two years ago. This year and this past year it’s become part of that. That’s what’s driving what we do. We’ve always been determent to deliver strong shareholder values with a focus on execution and effective capital allocation. As we maintain the right team of people noticeably better people on our organization, as we grow our business, as we maintain market access in those critical growing regions of agriculture in the world, we will deliver shareholder value.', 'Our ability to execute our strategy is important. This is a bricks and mortar business in the extreme; to us, to you to all our shareholders the global food security we have to be excellent at execution. Feeding a growing world is an enormous responsibility and it brings with it huge opportunities for shareholders and all our stakeholders. Growing demand for food is what will drive Mosaic’s long term success. Population growth is half the story. I will tell you the other half in a moment. This is a daunting task.', 'This shows going up to 2100, everybody knows Dr. Mike Ron, he is now getting into 100 forecasts by quarter. They are about as accurate as his two year forecast by quarter. But this is a UN chart and you have seen it recently and it shows UN’s high estimate of population growth that by 2100 the world is going to have 16 billion more people. Three times of what we have today almost three times of what we have or 2.5 times of what we have today. Africa by itself is expected to grow from the 1 billion people today to 4.1 billion in 2100 and that is UN’s (medium) case. Keep in mind the world’s population didn’t reach 4 billion until 1975, so 40 years ago since, in the last 40 years the world’s population has grown by 75%.', 'And so I don’t think these are too extreme and you look at the medium case and that is where it plateaus at about 9 or they are talking maybe 10 million people by the year 2050. But there is more to the food story than just increasing number of mouths to feed. Many parts of the world where it is the greatest population growth is seeing the greatest income growth and these are populations that aren’t going from average incomes of $40,000 a year to $45,000. These are in parts of the world where income is going from a $1,000 to $1,500 to $2,000 a year. When populations improve their income, they demand more protein and this chart shows you what has happened with that, in just 60 years Asia alone meat consumption has increased six fold and that is a lot of people demanding more protein. And more protein, I have told many of you it takes a lot more grain. I will just say it again, one pound of chicken requires three pounds of corn, one pound of pork requires four pounds of corn to produce that pound of pork.', 'And in the case of beef the Holy Grail of all proteins, it takes seven pounds of corn to produce one pound to finish beef and varies in between that five and seven. So you can see the leveraging power that protein consumption has on the demand for grains and oil seeds around the world it is extraordinary. And that is another statistic that just sounds ridiculous but we do have the data to back it up. The world’s farmers in the next 50 years has to produce as much food as the world has produced in the past 10,000 years just a stunning statistic and that isn’t going to be done without more technology crop nutrition products and technologies. Now here is a closer look at how this impacts agriculture. You have on my right your left demand for grains and oil seeds shown to grow at a steady and brick pace.', 'Every year there is a couple little dip years economic crisis but there is a pretty straight line that goes over the last 30 years and we predict to go, continue to grow. On my left you can see what happens with grain production. It isn’t quite so this is actual area farmed there is the bars and the yellow shows the actual yields that we have seen. That isn’t as predictable more cyclicality more ups and downs in that and the black line demonstrates the trend line yield we have to continue to grow to keep up with world demand and you could see that in many of the years we have gaps that the world doesn’t grow as much food as is being demanded.', 'So we could only do this with good crop nutrition. The FAO part of the UN is estimated that up to 60% of grain and oil seed yields and grown crops in the world are due to crop nutrition manufactured crop nutrition products. That is good news for Mosaic and that is good news for the shareholders. Now this is an even more compelling story; taking a look at that farmer’s perspective. Farmers are prospering all around the world. Not every single farmer, not every single crop, there are some that are having some tough times but in general grain and oil seed producers are doing well.', 'Grain and oil seed prices are elevated even as crop nutrients remain at low costs. Farmers had every incentive to grow good crop and what this shows is our own in-house developed metric showing Plant Nutrient Affordability Index this is 2008, 2009 where grain prices were, corn was at $8 and phosphates and potash were to a 1,000. While you can see it has come down and well below that 10 year line here, crop nutrients are very cheap. With high prices for their outputs, low prices for their inputs, very high global demand, farmers are doing well and we expect this coming year we are going to have just a blockbuster fall season in North America following a darn good season in Brazil.', 'Mosaic’s in a great position to make a meaningful contribution to what has become one of the defining challenges of our time. Some days it is on the front pages some days it isn’t but it regularly comes back there one of the most defining challenges of our time I believe is how we are going to grow food for the world this is again good news for all stakeholders and investors in Mosaic.', ""And with that, I am going to conclude and turn it over to Joc O'Rourke our Executive Vice President, COO and he is going to talk to you about some of the operational plans and challenges that we have going forward. Joc over to you, thank you again.""]",management_discussion,MOS_57667
3095,Joc O'Rourke,"[""Thank you, Jim, and welcome everybody to our Analyst Day. Some of you haven't met me before and I don't talk to this group as often as some of the others. So let me just give you some of my background. I spent the last 30 years in the mining industry and I developed and operated mining operations all around the world. It was almost 25 years ago now when I was involved in my very first $1billion plus project in the jungles of Papua New Guinea, and I tell you it was a time when it was very challenging to do big projects in places like Papua New Guinea and it was certainly a time when a $1 billion was a big, big project."", ""So since that time I've been involved in a number of very large projects and integrations, acquisitions, etc. and what I've learned from all of that is what really matters, is the disciplines that come around your strategy, your planning and your execution. Those are critical to your business and then once you're in operations driving the productivities and efficiencies that make sure you get the most out of those very expensive assets that you build. This is a cyclical industry and one of the things we have to realize, we have to do the things we can do, the things we can control to make sure we get superior returns through the whole cycle."", ""Before I jump into the guts of my presentation, I just want to go back to what Jim said. We at Mosaic are very focused on the execution of our strategy. We're going to control the things we can control so that we do give the best results for our shareholders and that we're able to adapt to any set of market conditions. So, today what I'm going to talk about is our intent to grow free cash flow which is obviously the critical thing for any business. In phosphates as you are aware, most of our growth has been and will continue to be inorganic growth and I'll talk about that a little later. In potash we still have quite a bit of room in our Brownfield expansions, so we can bring on new production as it's required. In both businesses we're going to be very focused on expanding our margin. First by cost management in all of our businesses, making sure that we minimize or optimize our sustaining capital and then of course developing our premium product portfolio and really bringing that higher margin, high return product to market. Anton, thank you."", ""As you know we have two major joint ventures in our phosphate business. The first of those is Miski Mayo joint venture in Peru and the second one is our new Saudi joint venture with Ma’aden. In 2010 we entered into an agreement with Valle, to become members of the Miski Mayo joint venture, we paid them $385 million for a 35% economic interest in that project and the right to receive 35% of the phosphate rock concentrate coming from that project. That investment has gone extremely well for us. Currently [indiscernible] is supplying us approximately 1.3 million tons of phosphate rock per year. And in 2012 when we had the South Fort Meade injunction, we were fortunate because it was supplying us with about 1 million tons at that stage. And that was rock that if we hadn't got from [indiscernible] we certainly would have had to purchase on the open market and probably at a much higher price than what we ended up paying."", ""Since the inception of the Miski Mayo joint venture, we have received about $60 million in dividends and distribution and that doesn't include the equity earnings that appear on our earnings statement every quarter. So the Saudi joint venture, it is also proceeding much as planned. Front end engineering is progressing well, we have left three of the eight major project components and we are in final negotiations for the other five to complete that project. The operation is on track for a late 2016 start up. Once this plant is operational though, what we expect to see is a property at the very low end of the cost curve with very advantaged rock, ammonia and sulfur. So because of that we expect a superior return from this project and well above our risk rated cost of capital. Finally the other advantage to the Saudi project is that will give us the option to co-invest with Ma'aden in future expansions of this project or others in Saudi Arabia. For the long term we really like the phosphate industry and are open to any inorganic growth in this industry as long as it sits very low on the cost curve and reaches, exceeds or meets our risk adjusted [indiscernible]."", ""So let me go into the phosphate margins and this is something that's been a little bit confusing for people because we do combine our distribution and manufacturing as one P&L. I’m going to get into that in a second. So in phosphates though raw material prices tend to move sort of in conjunction with the actual price of the phosphate, so it’s not great look at singly at price you really have to look at the margins and that’s what this shows. And as I just mentioned, because we managed the P&L of the distribution and the manufacturing segment together in a holistic way, what we’ve done here is we actually try to pull that out so you can start understanding what’s going on."", 'So what we’ll see in this is that for instance in 2013 when the manufacturing margin was 23%, the overall segment margin was about 18%. So what is this mean? To put into its context, we sell roughly 2.5 million tons of blended crop nutrients. Those however are sold at a relatively lower margin probably in the single digits, but they do add incremental revenue and they allow us to run our phosphate business particularly a lot more steadily and they allow us to optimize our production capability. Then the other one is quite important from the distribution, you’re going to hear lot more from this with Floris is, it is the platform by which we are able to sell our premium products outside of North America.', 'So great value add in that business we believe and a great differentiator for us. Overall in prospects, we have been able to maintain pretty darn good margins and those you can see from here on the line of top at 20% or above gross margins in the manufacturing, which is quite attractive for a commodity business. Let’s take into component for that then, first of all our mining and I’m quite proud of the team’s accomplishments in mining. As you can see here, fiscal ’13 our cost both cash and total were lower than they were in 2009. We have been able to reduce our cost from where were five years ago.', 'And sometimes really necessity does become the mother of invention. As you can see in 2011 and 2012, our costs were up slightly because of our South Fort Meade injunction. So South Fort Meade was partially idle because of the injunction or what we did in the meantime is our Four Corners mine, Wingate and Hookers Prairie really took up the slack, we really made big improvements on the productivity of those mines; and now that South Fort Meade has come back into operation, we have been able to leverage that experience to bring South Fort Meade back better than it ever was before and as you can see from the cost it is really driven our cost down in mining.', 'In terms of our manufacturing, we’ve done well but the overall trajectory isn’t exactly what we’d like to see and we believe there is room for improvement. In here, we have a couple of things. MicroEssentials adds great additions to our margin over DAP. It does add some cost in terms of our manufacturing. So as we expect to increase our MicroEssentials in the future, we have to take that into account as well. Now we expect out conversion cost or our manufacturing cost going forward, to be more on the 2012 range and the reason we say that we had a couple of went offs in 2013 that we don’t believe will recur and so we see that as where we go forward.', 'And we also have a lot of cost reduction efforts in place in particular, we’re looking at all of our things, every production related cost and between improved automation continuous improvement and better reliability of our equipment through better planning, we expect we will be able to offset inflation and drive down cost in this business. In terms of sustaining capital, we expect we will be able to maintain our sustaining capital, it about the $215 million mark. Depreciation in this business however is real and we do need to spend money to maintain our equipment in good order that said through privatization a new program for mechanical integrity and reliability, we can optimize these investments going forward.', 'Let me move onto Potash, I think we’ve all talked about our potash expansions in the past but just want to recap that of the 3 million tons $3 billion projects that we started few years back. We have one project that’s essentially still ongoing, our K3 mine where we’re sinking shafts and the necessary infrastructure to support that mine operation. Larry is going to provide more detail on the economics of these projects, but I would like to say is these projects have been done on time on scope and on budget, and this is no small task considering the inflationary pressure and labor tightness in the province of Saskatchewan.', 'Our success here really reflects our 50 years of experience in mining and projects in the province of Saskatchewan.', ""Let me talk a little bit about the Esterhazy K3 which is the one that's still ongoing. We have about $1 billion left to spend at K3, we have completed the headframe, we have installed headframe for both the personnel and production. We have done all the pre-sync and what all we had to do, we have installed the Galloway and now we're into full sync mode to take these shafts down to our ore [indiscernible]. Take down to the ore will take us approximately to 2016 and then we'll be at our range of being able to hoist about 2.7 million tons a year and delver 900,000 tons of ore per year for the K2, 900,000 tons of product per year by milling at the K2 mill."", 'As we look at how we built K3, we built it for optimum flexibility. In terms of production as well as timing to bring on incremental tons. So what we said here is by using both shaft and a conveyer system going over the K1 and K2 mill, we can build the K3 systems ultimately deliver 19 million tons of ore and 6.3 million tons of products. We will steadily ramp up the K3 over the next decade basically, giving us the option to ultimately migrate our production K1 and K2 and eliminate our brine inflow cost. This will also help reduce long term sustaining capital.', 'Esterhazy today is the largest underground potash mine in the world. With the efficiency to scale as well as the potential to eliminate brine inflow cost, we expect that in a decade this will be one of the lowest cost potash mine in the world.', 'Looking back historically as you can see from this slide margins in the potash business have been impacted by both realized price and asset utilization rates, with resource taxes directly linked to our profitability. As I said earlier inflation in Saskatchewan has been significant. In the last few years and our labor cost have gone up, plus we have added about 900 people to support the expansions that we have been building. At the same time realized potash prices have gone down into the low $300 range and with roughly 75% of our total costing we have seen a deterioration of margins, all be it still very attractive in terms of industry.', 'The next thing I just want to talk to is a little bit of detail about our operating cost by mine, and to do that I need to explain this graph or table, and to do that what we have done here is the bubbles on this represent the size of the production of the given operating rate. The [indiscernible] access, represents the cash cost of production including royalties but excluding the resource taxes. And then the vertical represents the total production cost, so you get the whole set up of it.', 'And you can see from this, last year fiscal 2013 Esterhazy, much is said about how these different cost curves and everything else. Esterhazy had a cost of $137 upon cash cost and Mosaic overall had a cost of about $135. As you can see our most efficient mine Belle Plaine on the left of the graph which had cost in the range of $100 because of the low cost of natural gas in North America right now.', 'On the right hand side our smaller higher cost Carlsbad mine did have higher cost from the rest, but Carlsbad is where we make K-Mag, which is a higher margin premium product that we believe adds real value to our portfolio. If we [indiscernible] the fourth quarter 2013 as a proxy for what our business would look like if we are running at more optimum operating rates i.e. 90 plus percent operating rates. You can see a big shift in this graph going to the left, particularly now Esterhazy has moved from the $140 range to under $120. Now recognize that does include brine management cost, so this is not anything other than that. Mosaic is now under $120 and Belle Plaine is under $100 of operating cost. And when we start looking the cost curve, I think that becomes significant.', ""Here we're, so where does this put us on the cost curve? First based on CRUs latest analysis there is not merely as much difference in the cost curve as some would have you believe. There is a lot of variability in the industry cost curves, but if you cut through all of that noise there is really quite a slim variance in the difference between the major producers."", 'So when you look there at what it looks like the delivered product through our mid-west U.S. warehouse, Mosaic is actually very low on the cost curve. Clearly this is the reason we sell probably 50% of our products into North America it’s where we’re cost advantaged.', 'Another key country is China; here Mosaic is still quite competitive despite not having the same rate advantage that we have in North America. If we look forward now and talk about what K3 can do for Mosaic under our long term plan at Esterhazy K1 and K2 production rates will begin to wind down at some point.', 'We have replaced those ton with lower cost efficient K3 ton without -- at this stage without brand management cost and considering the size and scale of our facilities in Canada, Mosaic Canadian potash producers -- production would be in the first quarter by the middle of next decade. So, that’s significant we really will be able to move our production down into the first quarter.', 'Regarding capital now, recently our capital spent last year was 400 million, up from 250 million in 2011 for sustaining capital. But when we look at that a 100 million of that was to build our self Farfield injection project. That Farfield injection project greatly and has ability to manage brine investor. So, it’s on a great value plus it was a one off nonrecurring. So, as we look forward we really believe we can manage our capital in the range of $250 million we put a lot of new equipment despite the fact that our depreciation is going up it is new equipment and we expect we can maintain our capital much below the actual depreciation right now.', 'So to summarize, we feel really good about our track record to successfully executing strategic investment. In phosphates our cost containment efforts have really delivered better profitability for that sector. In potash our expansions have been executed extremely well. Now, going forward we have aggressive plans for continues cost improvements in both the businesses which when combined with the strength of our assets really positions us well to generate superior cash flow across the whole business cycle.', 'Thank you. And with that I want to hand it over to Floris to talk about our Go-to-Market strategy.']",management_discussion,MOS_57667
3096,Floris Bielders,"['Thank you, Joc. Good afternoon, I’m here today to give you insights in Mosaic’s Go-to-Market strategy. All main phosphates and potash [indiscernible] at the wrong way and we still reach the customers but none of them has level like ours. And I believe that the way we reach our customers gives us a significant competitive advantage.', 'In the next 20 minutes or so I will talk about how we serve our customers and why in our opinion that Mosaic works well across.', 'I will first tell you that thing we will cover in the next 20 minutes. I’ll first give you an idea of where we sell our product the geographical spread then we talk about the channels that we use to reach these customers and I’ll give you an idea of our market access strategy, our philosophy behind the whole thing if you will.', 'Once we are done with that theoretical part we’ll look deeper into two specific examples of regions that we sell a lot of products to, one being the North American region and the other one Brazil. These are interesting to contrast because on the one hand they have a lot in common in terms of size and crops but there also at the same time very different. One of them being mature the other one not only growing but also developing in the way our customers want to be served.', 'Now, where our products go to first the case of [indiscernible] if you look at this table we have for some time in [indiscernible] that we are focusing a sales more in the Americas, you can see here that is exactly what we have done, we have shifted products always from market like India and we are selling more in the America. The different way to look at that is on this map the darker color; the darker the color is the more products we sell in this market you can clearly see that the majority of our terms stay in the America.', 'This is for several reasons I mentioned two of them none of them is obvious one logistical advantages as it’s easier to reach customers that are close to where your production facilities are. The other reason is that the Americas has the source equips and the climate that are perfectly suited for the products we produce particularly for MicroEssentials type premium products.', 'Now, I do want to point out an important thing that while we have a strong focus only Americas we continue to maintain an important foothold in markets like Japan, Australia and India. Particularly India is important not only because it is still one of the largest importing markets for phosphates products but also because in the years to come we expect to have about a million tons of phosphate products the market are not in joint venture and India of course is a perfect destination market for that product.', 'Not only have we changed over the past few years where we sell our products we’ve also made a significant shift in what type of product we could chose in the case of Phosphate. As you can see here on the slide, in calendar ’14, that is after we have made some more changes at our Riverview plant to be able to have more flexibility on our product mix, we will have as much as 62% of our phosphate product [indiscernible] our phosphate product in the form of MicroEssentials and MAP, which is not only good because it very well suits the soils of the Americas, these products also give us better margins. So it allows us to serve our customers better and improve overall margins.', 'Now let’s look at potash. Our potash products are predominantly in seven different countries. You first have the North American region, here in [indiscernible] where we saw roughly half of the potash that we produce, managed by our own sales team. And then we have the rest goes for export. A little bit of the exports come from Carlsbad that’s predominantly a K-Mag and the rest of the Canadian exports are handled, like Jim already mentioned, through Canpotex. Canpotex, the bulk of their tons go to five main markets. You see those in blue here, Indonesia, Malaysia, India, China and Brazil.', ""For Mosaic, in the case of Brazil and China, we go one step further. We have our own distribution network in these countries. We'll go into a little more detail about this later, if we pick up the product in the ports from Canpotex and then we distribute it deeper down the channel. We do this differently than we do it in other markets with our sales, because for instance we sell a larger part to farmers and also in a different form, in the form of blends."", 'To be clear when we talk about blends, these are physical blends. We simply mix the phosphate, potash and nitrogen to get our blend so that we can serve the particular soil and crop of the farmers; best as opposed to an NPK which is a chemical blend. We do not produce those. So we reach farmers direct. We use blends to give you an example. In the case of Brazil as much as 70% of the sales we make is in the form of blend and more than 50% sold direct to farmers.', 'In North America, those numbers would be zero and zero; a very different approach. And while in the case of potash, really the Asian markets are more important for us than in the case of phosphate, even there we are growing the sales we make into the Americas.', 'Now let’s look at the channels that we use to reach the market. The channel we use depends basically on one of two things; either the destination where the product goes to or the product itself. You can see here on the slide. We first had Canpotex focusing on the export of our potash, out of Canada through the imports in Vancouver and Portland. And then the phosphate exports that go to third party customers around the world are currently handled through PhosChem and as I am sure you have heard as often you refers to our own international sales people.', 'In North American market where we sell all products, phosphate, potash and feed phosphate and finally the international distribution business that I am actively involved. Each of these channel serve customers in a distinctly different way. And that’s why they’re very much complementary. Let’s have a quick look before we go into the North American and Brazil examples into the strategy behind our marketing.', 'First of all we try to use the strategy of how we approach customers the same way wherever we go in the market. We try to have the same kind of concept used everywhere. To give you some examples of this, first of all we prefer to manage the logistics. That is to say we prefer if we can sell customers on a delivery basis rather than on an ex-plant basis. The reason for that is that that way we can keep the flow out of our plant going, so we don’t [indiscernible] of our warehouses and our plant capacity and it also means we can better serve the customer to make sure they get our products right in time.', 'Most of our sales are to customers that have a long-term history with us. That boom goes both ways and it’s very often enhanced with annual or sometimes multi-annual supply contract. As a result only a low percent of our sales goes to opportunistic customers.', 'Another important component of our strategy is the premium products like MicroEssentials that Rick and McLellan will talk further about.', 'I think an area of our strategy that has not really been talked about enough is the well-recognized brands that we have. We have brands for product like K-Mag, Pegasus and MicroEssentials that are increasingly differentiating us from our competitors. To give you two examples, in North America last year 25% of our sales was done under a branded product, and in most cases these branded products give us a better margin. That percent was only 14% as little as three years ago.', 'The brand strength is not only working for us in the case of premium products, but I will give you an example. In China we get $40 to $50 upon premium for our DAP over the locally produced DAP and so even though China is one of the larger exporters of phosphate now, from time to time this allows us to bring one or two [indiscernible] of DAP into China at a time that’s for our competitors that is not economically viable simply because we get that significantly.', 'And finally the wide range we have of different phosphate end product, potash product, clearly makes it interesting for customers to work with us because that’s exactly what many customers want.', 'Now, while we try to use the strategy on the global basis, the tactics if how we approach customers is different in different destinations. So to give you an example, some countries we will ship the products in bags, in other countries we will not do that. No other phosphate or potash producer as a market excess strategy that matches Mosaic with product portfolio geographic reach all brand strength and I believe that that combination gives us a clear and [indiscernible].', 'Now let’s look at those two markets, first North America. In North America, our goal is to be the phosphate and potash supplier of choice to the customers that are most attractive to us. We try to achieve this by being a consistent and reliable supplier and by offering a range of products and services yet it’s hard to copy. To give you some examples, we have worked with some of the retailers that sale our MicroEssentials we have trained their sales force and how to sale value, how do you really get paid for this product that is so much better than what else is in the market. We also help them setting up marketing campaigns and as we widen the margin for our customers, they will share that with us and so we’ll both later on.', 'Another important component of our strategy in North America is the Exclusive Space Program. This is a program only given to select, strategic customers under which we keep their warehouse supply with phosphate and potash throughout the year. With the customer this has to benefit that they know they have secured supply, the do not have to worry whether they will have the product when they needed and they have given some flexibility at the point of the pricing [indiscernible] final price before its pricing.', 'The Mosaic, the benefit is that we secure the demand. We know for sure that these customers will buy from us. We also have the advantage that we manage the shipment from our plants to the customer warehouse. So you can ship when it suits you best and finally it allows us to optimize the logistics because we control the timing and the method of shipment.', 'If you take a closer look at the map, you see here the arrows in the North of course you have the potash products, here in the South the phosphate and kind of in the middle you have this North American customer base that we are servicing.', 'Now, unlike imports which pretty much all come through the river, we service customers by truck, by rail and by barge. This gives us a clear competitive advantage in a few different ways. Number one, we have a lower cost to serve many of these customers and we have a shorter time to reach them which allows for last minute changes in reaching customers in time that need more product.', 'We also, as you can see in the map with the orange circles, this is our warehouse system that we have in North America where we can store products so we can reach our customers just in time in the season. All of this has allowed us to sale roughly 50% of our phosphate and potash production in the North American geography.', 'Now we get to the international distribution part. This is the part that I am actively involved and so this is my favorite part of the presentation. The number of countries we have been active in with distribution has varied over the years and the reason for that is that we only want that we are there where we can sale product that we produce in our own plant in North America and so currently we are active in Argentina, India, China, Brazil, and Chile.', 'The last fiscal year, we shipped 4.5 million tons of fertilizers in these countries. That 4.5 million includes everything so that includes nitrogen as well, about two-thirds of that is phosphate and potash and much of that phosphate and potash we can source from our friends in North America. This is very important. The distribution channel is a means to an end; we use this to sell products for our own production. Because of this, we also try to keep the nitrogen component off the sales in these countries low and we are not active in either seed or agro chemical sales.', 'Having controlled access to market gives us several significant advantages. First of all, these operations are fully aligned with our upstream production that means that the plants in North America can always count on that demand. Good times or more difficult times when the demand in general is a little bit slack-like which is today, the distribution networks will take that [indiscernible]. It also allows us to tailor (ph) train the sales teams. We have for instance in Brazil 90% of our sales force are agronomist, we trained these people so that they can sale—value particularly important for products like MicroEssentials. It is not for nothing that a high percentage of the exported MicroEssentials end up in our distribution network and that is where we make the highest margins.', 'We also capture the downstream margin that is available in these countries. These margins very over time and by country but on average you can say we are making mid-single digit gross margins.', 'And finally, the last advantage is simply having ears on the ground in important markets like India, Brazil, China, gives us an insight of what happens in these markets.', 'Now this brings us to Brazil. Last year in Brazil Mosaic’s distribution network sold 3.3 million metric tons, and as you heard from Jim, we have a strong growth strategy. And so the question you could ask is why do you want to grow? Well, the answer to that extent is in this slide.', 'You see here in the graph the growth of acreage and crops grown in Brazil, a very clear upward trend that we expect to continue. If you look at the insert here this gives the global ranking for Brazil, number one in crop here oranges, sugar cane. There is a fair amount of excitement there under the Brazilian farmers at the moment partly because they think that their team will become world champion soccer next year and then we’ll have to see about that. But partly because they actually think that for the first time in history Brazil will produce more soybeans than the United States.', 'And if that happens that boards well for the demand of potash and phosphate because soybeans as you may know barely use nitrogen, so this is a great crop for a product like a company like Mosaic. And on top of that the soils in Brazil are such that they need a little fertilizer. And so on an acre of soybeans planted in Brazil you need 3.5 times as much phosphate and potash as you need in the United States. So if you wanted one single reason why it makes sense to grow in Brazil that maybe just the one.', 'Okay, now we’ll go to the next slide. So in the end we’re not in the grain business but the grain -- the size of the crop, the size of the acreage results in increased demand. This is partly also the case because surprisingly enough the soils in much of Brazil are not all that great they have sandy low fertility soils with abundant rain. And so if you want to reach your yield potential you need to very significantly fertilize the crops. Here you see our forecast for growth for the fertilizer demand in the years to come this is a compound average growth rate of about 4%. This is our forecast but frankly forecast from others don’t vary comparably much.', 'Now this is all the fertilizer demand frankly we don’t care as much about neither as we do about the other products. So here we have a slide that talks about phosphate and potash. Now Brazil is an interesting country in this respect because no less than 67% of all the fertilizer used in Brazil is phosphate and potash, 67%. This compares to about 39% on a global basis, rest of course is nitrogen. So this makes Brazil a very attractive market for phosphate and potash producer like Mosaic. Now Brazil imports a significant part of its phosphate. This slide somehow doesn’t do justice to that in 2012 the imports were 4.3 million tons so that’s significant amount of imports but the real [jump] is in the MOP supply, 90% to 95% of all the MOP used in Brazil is imported and we do not expect that to change much over the years to come.', 'Okay, so what does that mean for our growth strategy? We have a five year plan to grow our business with about $300 million of investment. That $300 million is needed basically for two main purposes; the first one is to add blend capacity and warehousing capacity; the second one is logistic optimization. Much of the fertilizer demand in Brazil is [surf] to farmers in the form of blended products and therefore if you want to grow you need to build blend plants. To give you some example let’s click here. The yellow areas is where we already have approved our project and are actively implementing them. To give you some examples is Sorriso that is the [Miritituba] area. This [Miritituba] area I was there a few weeks ago. If you ever want to get a sense of what changed in agriculture means you need to visit [Miritituba] not only is the area expanding but these farmer are so ready to soak any different any change you have to offer in how they can become better and more efficient.', 'There is almost no place in Brazil but maybe anywhere else in the world where our MicroEssentials are doing better than in this area simply because the farmers are so ready to change. So this Sorriso plant that is a blend plant where today have increase in the 50,000 tons capacity, we’re expanding that to 700,000 tons. [Candeias] same story, we’re expanding our blending capacity. And then you get Paranaguá. This is a port project where we are expanding the capacity of our crop that gets me actually I am skipping something let’s go back for a second. Before we go and talk a little more about the logistics, I want to explain that the strategy we have is very much is a modular strategy. So that means that for building it up over time and we’re building it our self, it’s an organic growth strategy. The advantage of doing it this way is that we can build the facilities exactly where we wanted and we will end up with modern low cost facilities that can exactly serve the customers the way we would like it to.', 'Now we’re going to go to the logistics area. Historically, Brazil it’s actually today Brazil has served its imports through the ports in the south of Paranaguá, Uberaba, Rio Grande and Sorriso. And the fact is that the capacity of this port has not kept up with the fast growth of the fertilizer impact. So the waiting time of these ports is often horrendous. last year from June to November which is the peak season the average waiting time at the public terminal was 50 days with a peak at 74 days so I take 15,000 barrels a day on average for the merit is very expensive to operate okay. Price of terminals like always last year in the same period only had 14 days waiting time so a part of our plan is to invest money in expansion of our Paranaguá port, but equally exciting and great opportunity is to grow in logistics through the North.', 'What is happening you have the Amazon River in the North and because the areas in which farmers grow their crops have slowly moved for the North it has become possible for grain companies to start exporting from Paranaguá Saudi’s area where you have to service a plant to truck the grain North to the Amazon River and then export it from there and all those trucks that drive North then go back empty so a great opportunity for us to invest in four facilities on the Amazon River and then use that cheap freight to go South and get the fertilizer to the farmers and the good thing about it is that the farmers in Mato Grosso will not only be helped by better prices for the grain because the logistics benefit but also for fertilizer.', 'And therefore only speed up in my view to grow access market so clearly there is a shift in how the Brazil cut short and this truly is an opportunity for us to help shape the future of Brazil agriculture.', 'Finally summing it up we believe that we have a different way of reaching our customers several complimentary channels to reach the customers strong positions in the market that really matter excellent long term relations with our customers and a clear strategy for growth in Brazil and on top of that we have this premium products MicroEssentials that Rick McLellan Head of Commercial will explain to you further about. Thank you.']",management_discussion,MOS_57667
3097,Rick McLellan,"[""Thanks Floris that was a very good and quick description about what we do around the world. It is going to be my job to spend a little bit of time and talk to you about our premium product strategy and why we place it in such high priority in Mosaic. The short answer is, it’s good for all of us, it’s good for farmers, our retail distributors our own Mosaic company and our shareholders. Now the devil is in the details so let’s take a quick look. In our view premium products contribute primarily to two of our five strategic priorities. Growth and innovation, I can also argue to support Floris’ points that these products are instrumental to our market access in certain parts of the world so that's three out of the five."", 'And thinking of it we have some of our most talented people working on this strategy and their energy and enthusiasm is infectious still the people that now covers four of five. And of course our premium products deliver shareholder value as I will demonstrate shortly so there you have it. Premium products can be seen as impacting and frankly driving our whole strategy.', 'Well some might ask why do we produce these products. First and foremost we are meeting a need in global production agriculture; let’s start with a little bit of science of crop production. Crop nutrients supplied in a balanced manner attribute to 60% of grain production and that percentage is only higher in tropical areas like Brazil plants need a wide range of nutrients starting with the primary micronutrients of NPNK we have had our focus on the big three for 100s of years but to reach maximum grain production secondary nutrients and micronutrients are essential.', 'And I should note that micronutrients are not just critical to plant growth humans require them too. In fact the World Health Organization research indicates that zinc deficiency in diets affects 2 billion people annually and contributes to 800,000 deaths per year of which over half all children. We are helping to combat this problem we started with sulfur in our first MicroEssentials product and we have been expanding from there through the additions of other micronutrients including zinc. We are proud to be the only large crop nutrition company that is committed to this kind of innovation.', ""Our portfolio of products has been successful and it will continue to grow KMAG has been around for a long time but it still is the only inter [indiscernible] introduced in the potash market in decades, hang on for a bit and bear with me because that's about to change. Micro essentials has been a tremendous success and [indiscernible] our phosphate animal feed product is delivering that premium value to feed producers and the integrators."", ""And our R&D pipeline is full. We have several potential potash and phosphate products in our stage gate process currently. Important for me to note that we're really quite disciplined about our R&D approach. We put every new product idea through a multi stage approval process all the way through the field trials and we're not afraid to pull the plug on any product concept that doesn't pan out."", ""The whole development process is highly efficient. We reach go or no go decisions with limited cost commitments nor emotional attachment. Here's a philosophy behind our products our strategies. Our premium products deliver profitability and sustainability for the ultimate end user, the farmer, but also for the retailer and for Mosaic, we're helping retailers and farms grow better crops, make more money, build deeper relationships and improve their sustainability. All while Mosaic reaps some of the same benefits. Frankly it's a good and more importantly repeatable cycle."", ""Micro essentials product are clearly differentiated from other commodity phosphates. Here's one of our commercials that airs primarily in the Corn Belt in the US. It'll give you some idea of how MicroEssentials works in the field and why we believe there's a compelling value proposition."", '[Commercial]', ""We're quite proud to be part of this change and for sure this isn't your daddy's crop nutrition company, we're driving change, we're delivering on our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs. The real story with micro essentials though is about creating value. Our yield trials show on average a 4-7% increased yields from using micro essentials. This graphs show the incremental value, a farmer realizes per acre using micro essential, instead of their usual phosphate utilization program, with just 2% yield increase which frankly is a conservative view. The farmers receive $17 in incremental value per acre, while on a per ton basis a $147 per ton of fertilizer purchased at a 4% yield increase which is frankly much more common. The benefits are all much significant we're driving other yield and we're helping farmers feed to world and we are making better margins. The secret to a product success is understanding how value is created and we've done that and shared equitably."", 'The questions you have to ask, because every part of the value chain benefit and can you deliver a fair share of that benefit for the end user. If the answer to these two questions is no, the product will fail. The end users, in this case farmers will not support a product for the long term if they don’t get their share of the value, but if the answer to these two questions is yes, you have micro essentials, farmers get approximately 60% of the value, while Mosaic and retail distributors garner the remainder.', ""Our focus during the past two years has been on training and assisting our own customer facing employees and our retail distributors in garnering their fair share of the value created. I must admit we have had many successes and some failures, but we're gaining ground with this exercise. Demand for micro essentials continues to grow at a very brisk pace and we're see it expand rapidly outside of North America, especially as Floris pointed out - in Brazil. Micro essentials are not easy to manufacture as Joc has pointed out, which by the way recreates significant competitive advantage. We're expanding our production capacity to keep up with demand increases that we expect in the future. We have plans to convert more of our phosphate facilities to micro essentials production in the next few years and we're evaluation additional ways to increase capacity further so that we can meet future demand."", 'As I mentioned earlier we will be introducing a new potash product in the near future, its branding is not quite ready for public yet, so for now, we’ll call it as we do experimental 2205. In our trials, it delivers the same benefits as our other premium products increasing yields, developing a return on investment to farmers, and delivering on our balanced crop nutrition promise.', ""The product right now is in the field frankly being harvested with a focus on building our yield data to support a formal product launch during January. Here' why we’re doing this. Again to the meet a customer need which have been identified in our research programs. The difference in these two pictures might not look that significant but it is. These are -- this is corn from same farm the same field and the same conditions. On the left is corn produced using the farmer’s current potassium fertilization program, compare this to the corn on the right produced using 2205 is its primary potassium source. I believe you can see the difference with 2205 as the kernels appear almost to the very top, it appears to have more than more rows of kernels and it does."", 'Additional role of kernels in the year of corn develops a farmer can reap an additional bushels even with today’s prices one additional rows with an incremental $40 an acre and as you can see most of these years have more rows. But unlike a fashion show, famers make decisions based upon proven yield increases not just looks which is why our focus is on building yield data to support our product launch. They tuned for that January launch. The new product helps the retailer just as significantly. Retailers are the one farmer thank for higher yields and we give retailers support to help their customers achieve this product’s potential that intern gives retailers long-lasting trust and relationships with their key farmer customers.', 'As a side benefit, the product is easy to store, requires less blending than potash and like its phosphates counterpart has all the nutrients in one granule for improved distribution in the field and in the crop. The strategy has a compounding effect for Mosaic. We use a selective distribution model to improve our ability to support those customers who choose to sell our premium products. This chart shows the growth that we’ve seen with customers in a large market in North America. In 2008, we supported only one retail distributor in this marketplace. In 2010, we realized the market was large enough to support a second retailer. As you might expect, the first retailer was concerned with another entering their marketplace and was concerned that their market would be cannibalized. Quite to the contrary, both of these customers have grown their purchases of MicroEssentials and their purchases of other Mosaic products. Changing our relationship, we have with these customers and our discussions today are all about how do we grow together, not about what’s the price today. We clearly are building upon our successes.', 'Finally, we do a lot to promote these innovative products and we do it efficiently. We have two interesting digital platforms that I encourage you to checkout. First, our pursuit of 300 Initiative is working with 6 Midwestern farmers chasing the elusive goal of profitably producing 300 bushels of corn per acre. The farmers frankly become local celebrities. In the program, it’s drawing great attention to both the use of balanced crop nutrition and our premium products. Check it out on Facebook or follow us on Twitter, there is a quite following of these group of six farmers.', 'Second, our new platform dedicated to helping with the message of balanced crop nutrition, cropnutrition.com is a long-term endeavor aimed at helping farmers achieve sustainably higher yields. These promotional efforts are real differentiators. We are the only large crop nutrient company with this kind of presence. Here to summarize, we feel great about where our premium products strategy has come from and where we’re headed. We are focused on delivering incremental value for all stakeholders and we’re in it to win it.', 'Now, I would like to introduce Larry Stranghoener, our Executive Vice President and CFO, Larry?', 'Larry Stranghoener', 'Thank you, Rick. Good afternoon all. Some of you may note I’m the token American on the program here this afternoon. I have spending a lot of time trying to explain to my Canadian and Dutch colleagues the workings of the American political system, which is taking up way too much time, but I am pleased to be here thanks all for here attendance. Today, you’ve heard how we’re going to executive our strategies, include about our plans to grow through higher volumes and through margin expansion. You have heard about our plans and expectations for continued growth in our premium products that described, that help drive grow our yields and capture higher margins for us.', ""You have heard us talk about our distribution capabilities, specifically how we're approaching Brazil, which is one of the fastest growing fertilizer markets in the world. Finally you have heard about our focus on operation and our focus on maintaining our position at the low end of the cost curve."", ""So what will be the actions needed for Mosaic and for our shareholders? What cash flow, what total shareholder return might expect from us in five years. To some extent of course that depends upon market condition, conditions that can be volatile as we've learned recently, crop nutrition is a cyclical business but we expect it to move higher over time as the ever increasing global demand for food evolves. Today I will show you a few financial scenarios based on our reasonable range of market conditions and the strategic actions my colleagues have described. First let me discuss the environment we expect to see in 2018."", 'We are certain that demand for food will grow, in fact by 2050 grain and oil seed demand is expected to grow by nearly 70%. We expect world demand for grains and oil seeds this decade to require the global agriculture add production equal to current output from Argentina, Brazil and Canada combined. Against this backdrop we have created come alterative scenarios for you to consider, we have used CRU data to project 2018 industry cost curves, these cost curves along with data from proprietary models are used to project three different scenarios each with phosphate and potash in the year 2018. Our model relies primarily on expected prices of soft commodities and expected supply and operating rates of potash and phosphate industries.', ""Plus before I get into a five year outlook let's visit our near-term outlook starting with phosphate. We have narrowed the range for our 2013 global finished phosphate shipments from 63 million to 64 million tons. Our current projection is off about 2 million tons from prior forecast, due mainly through large declines in shipments to India."", 'Our forecast for 2014 calls for a moderate rebound in response to lower phosphate prices and continued positive farm economics worldwide. In India our baseline estimate for 2014 includes a modest 1 million ton increase from the depressed level of 2013. Over the medium term horizon we expect supply to grow along with demand and we expect operating rates to move slightly higher beyond 2014.', 'We look for major market participants including the non-public companies to continue to be driven primarily by profitability goals. We also expect some large competitors to integrate into finished fertilizer production and finally we look for further consolidation in the industry.', 'Over the next five years Mosaic will continue executing our strategies going primarily by optimizing our current production, rolling premium products, completing the Saudi Arabian joint venture and speaking other goods strategic investments. We expect our investments in supply chain, distributions to improve our flexibility and ability to optimize both production levels and our net backs.', ""We are well aware that a low cost position is critical in maximizing margins in any market scenario; this chart shows you our projected phosphate industry cost curve five years from now. You will note that we expect to remain in a very attractive position. It's important to keep in mind the commodity based raw materials account for a significant account component of our cost and projecting phosphate scenarios, the projected price is not as relevant as the projected striping margins, or the projected difference between price and the cost of ammonia and sulfur."", 'The plan of $200 million in cost savings across all North America facilities as Joc described and proposed ammonia capacity would result in Mosaic continuing to be positioned in the best of bottom cost quartile as these cost savings were expected to offset inflation. The Louisiana operations are higher as we purchased phosphate, as we use phosphate from our Peruvian joint venture dislocation and the joint venture dividend is not taken into account in the chart.', ""This slide shows three potential scenarios for phosphate manufacturing cash margins depending upon the external markets. This is a different view than presented in our segment reporting as Joc described earlier, which includes distribution margins. I'll add that shortly."", 'All of the high level assumptions are shown in the printed handouts and in the webcast materials. We expect Mosaic production volumes in all three cases to be 7.9 million metric tons as we are already operating our phosphate’s business at capacity with our mines and chemical plants currently in balance. In each of these scenarios we’ve treated our Ma’aden joint venture as if it were accounted for as our own production. In other words we’ve included cash margins equivalent to the equity earnings we expect. In addition we’ve added a premium for our expected MicroEssentials volumes.', 'Marginal cost pricing in our likely scenario is based upon 88% [indiscernible] operating rate assumption resulting in a price of $450 per ton and a stripping margin of $265 per ton for a Florida based producer. In comparison today its price is about $390 in the stripping margin about $245 per metric ton. You can see that the phosphate business can continue to generate strong cash margins even if prices are low and that we have significant leverage to grow margins if prices rise.', 'Let’s move to our near term outlook for potash where we have lowered and narrowed the range of our 2013 global MOP shipment forecast to 54 million to 55 million tons from our pervious guidance of 55 million to 57 million tons. The reduction largely was in response to the challenges in India as well as delays in settling the second half 2013 Chinese contract volumes. In addition, buyers in many other key importing countries have differed purchases as they wait to see how the BCC saga plays out.', 'Our shipment has to work for 2014 else for moderate growth across virtually all markets driven by positive from economics and lower potash prices. We expect potash demand to grow by about 3% annually over the decade with operating rates moving slightly higher beginning in 2014. Review the price decline we’ve seen over the past 18 months which have accelerated recently reflect the fundamental supplying demand balance and declining industry operating rates and close to 90% since 2010-2011 to approximately 80% in 2012.', 'We expect that India will eventually obtain more balance in its crop nutrition application practices and ultimately that our share of Canpotex will be consistent with our 2010 share near 40%. Over the next 5 years we will continue to focus on execution, finishing our K3 expansion, managing our expenses and optimizing sustaining capital.', 'In the 2018 cost grew for potash, we have assumed that $200 million reduction and expenses due to the actions Joc described which primarily offsets inflation, please note that the chart shown here is FOB part and includes about $40 per ton to get product from our mine to Vancouver court.', 'In addition, if we invest to make K3 the source of all for our rest of these operations as Joc described in this K3 project by the way we think is the very best potash project underway in Canada Greenfield or Brownfield but with this -- if we go ahead with this our cost per ton would decline by $30 or more which is driven by the elimination of brine inflow cost at K1 and K2 this is not included by the way in our scenarios.', 'We continue to expect the potash cost to remain flat under the low case scenario for potash we use this cost curve and assume price equals the expected marginal cost of production or approximately $240 per ton or almost $200 FOB mine.', 'Here are the 2018 cash margin scenarios is been for potash because Mosaic has unused capacity in our potash production volumes vary by scenario in the medium and high scenarios volumes prices and industry operating rates are based upon our proprietary model assuming the same external market forces as in the phosphate scenarios.', 'In potash, the global operating in the medium scenario is 81% with Mosaic producing 9 million metric tons of MOP. In India the three scenarios just remains at highly profitable business. Here is the consolidated view. If we you add cash margins for the manufacturing scenarios I’ve already described and layering distribution cash margins, the medium phase scenario results in a $4.5 billion cash margin Mosaic 2018.', 'Just to be clear this is not operating earnings as we need to overlay SG&A and resource taxes as well as depreciation which we do here. When you add up all of the pieces, our three potential scenarios drive operating in the range from $1.4 billion in the low case to $4.7 billion in the high case, with a medium scenario of $3 billion. In these scenarios we assume SG&A cost of $380 million per year and that depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses increased to $850 million per year as we continue to invest increasing the depreciable asset base of our business. Note that these are the reasonable scenarios intended to demonstrate what our results might be. The high case is very exciting of course, and the low case is not as bad as some analyst seem to fear.', 'We expect the business to remain a cyclical business and of course we do not know where in the cycle we will be in 2018. So another way to view the medium scenario is that it is representative of a true cycle earnings number opposed to the average of the past five years but above our fiscal 2013 results, a year of market challenges. We look forward to producing ample cash flow over the next five years and effectively allocating it to generate strong shareholder value both through distributions and investments even as we maintain financial strength and flexibility.', 'We prioritize investments depending upon operating cash flow expectations, risk and expected returns because we operate in a cyclical business our decisions are based on the probability of exceeding our required risk based return and not on a point estimate or market forecast. We assign a minimum premium of one percentage point for project risk above our weighted average cost of capital between our assignment of risk premiums for project country and other risk our required rates of return vary from 10.3% up to 23.8%. We will not undertake projects unless we believe we have a high probability of meeting or exceeding our risk adjusted required returns.', 'As a proof point you see our completed potash projects fall in terms of returns keeping in mind that the projects are in varying degrees of production ramp up. Returns on all of these projects are very attractive and well above our weighted average cost of capital even with assumptions of long-term operating rates of 75% and sales prices of $335 per ton fob mine. The construction phase of all of these projects were executed well that the construction cost per ton of operating capacity among the lowest in the industry. These expansions will significantly lower our future operating cost per ton when operating at full capacity.', 'We are in a capital intensive business and we will continue to invest to sustain our assets, improve our competitive position and drive higher cash flow. Expected capital spending through 2016 consists of the five broad categories shown on this slide. On the bottom you will see the decline in sustaining capital Joc previously described as we expect to lower it to approximately $500 million per year from $700 million. We are continuing to invest in our future to low risk high return Brownfield expansions and joint ventures.', 'Capital spending for potash expansions shown on this chart consist of previously announced expansions, primarily the Esterhazy K3 project, we continue to believe our Brownfield expansions are likely to be the most cost-effective expansion when market conditions want additional capacity. The Ma’aden project provide significant strategic value to Mosaic and is a great compliment to our phosphate business in Florida and Louisiana. We will be investing up to a billion dollars over the next four years and we will own a 25% interest in the proposed project.', 'The international and supply chain investments reflect our plans to grow in Brazil and to invest in further supply chain improvements. We are finalizing our evaluation of the potential ammonia project in Louisiana and will announce the decision on that project by the end of this year. Additionally we will continue to manage working capital prudently. Given the seasonality of our industry, it’s an important value driver, the one we pay close attention to. The checking account is not unlimited and we have a rigorous process of evaluating and prioritizing new project proposals. We expect that under the vast majority of cases, capital investments will be funded from operating cash flow.', 'Today our balance sheet is one of the strongest in the business which has positioned us very well to take advantage of opportunities. In this environment our balance sheet targets remain unchanged. These targets consider the cyclical nature of the business and are conservative assuring us of appropriate liquidity and financial flexibility. We continue to target $2.25 billion of liquidity, with about one-third of that coming from cash in our balance sheet, the remaining two-thirds coming from committed credit lines. We are also looking to optimize our leverage at 1.5 times adjusted debt to average EBITDA where the rating agencies add pension and lease expenses to debt and estimate EBITDA over a five year period.', 'Some of you are curious as to what happened to the numbers on this slide that you have seen before. I will go into some explanation here. We estimate that we still have approximately $2 billion in on-balance sheet cash in excess of our targets, the majority of which is currently available. We believe however our near-term debt capacity has declined along with EBITDA expectations. Based on two year historical actuals and first call estimates for 2013 through 2015, our five year average EBTIDA has declined, which would lower our near-term targeted debt levels by 20% to 30%, compared to our prior $3 billion estimate.', 'That said, we continue to believe these balance sheet and liquidity targets constitute a material level of excess capital combined above $4 billion. Our priorities for deploying cash from operations have not changed. We seek to maintain our credit ratings and our liquidity cushion to sustain our assets and our payer dividends, to invest for growth and to return surplus capital to shareholders. The recent decline in valuations has increased the attractiveness of acquisitions and it has also made repurchases of our shares more attractive.', 'We continue to believe that share repurchases will be a material use of our excess capital and we look forward to later this year when current share repurchase restrictions expire. We continue to target mid-2014 with an even more optimal balance sheet structure.', 'In the near term when restrictions expire, we favor share repurchases as a key mechanism to help us optimize our balance sheet and ideally eliminate much of the Class A share overhang. Longer term, following resolution of the A share issue, we expect ongoing share repurchases to be both patterned and opportunistic. We also plan to maintain a reasonable dividend that is sustainable across the cycle and to increase it in line with business growth.', 'So what do we want you take away from our presentations today? First, management’s key priority is long term value creation, driven by growth in cash flow, prudent risk management and effective capital allocation. Second, we believe we can accomplish this value creation over a wide range of market scenarios. We expect to manage effectively through the troughs and deploy our balance sheet in value creating ways. Our ultimate goal is to be the leading crop nutrition company in the world and we know our major part of that is generating great returns for our shareholders.', 'With that Jim, I’ll turn it back to you for concluding comments.']",management_discussion,MOS_57667

We spent a lot of time talking about our strategy this afternoon and we did that because our strategy works, our strategy matters. We demonstrated that we can execute, we delivered solid returns, we built an extremely strong financial foundation and we have proven our ability to grow.', 'You saw powerful combination of the assets and hard earned corporate strengths we have. Joc gave you a well-defined path to greater operating efficiency and growth in our business units. Floris and Rick demonstrated their understanding of customer knowledge, the unique promising, commercial strategy that we have ahead of us, how differentiating premium products makes the difference at Mosaic and how far reaching customer focus, go-to-market strategy can really work and add value in this company. And Larry demonstrated the financial strength and competitive operating approach that we have that that can sustain good profitability even when phosphate and potash prices are low as they are today.', 'That’s our story. Now, just allow me a brief reflection on the last couple of years. We are going to be on the podium at the NYSE—at the Exchange shortly bringing the closing bell and we are just a few days away from the ninth anniversary of Mosaic’s creation, when we first rang that bell and on that day Mosaic came into existence as a public company.', 'So that was a top school of hard knocks education. We endured a lot in those first few years. We had much too much debt learned a lesson from that. Our markets were weak and our ratings were justifiably poor. This management team has now been together for many years and a number of them from the very first days. This has guided the company through some tough times and we’ve learned some real painful lessons. We’ve gained some tailwinds from the P&K markets that we’ve had over the last few years as well as the wind in our sales from corn and bean prices and prosperity down on the farm.', 'But to be sure through all this, we’ve taken the long term view. We know that when we’re flying at the top of the markets prices are high and margins are wide, we know that we’re going to see tough days and when we see tough days as we aren’t today, we know somehow, some way, it will change these markets will recover and we’ll see those peaks again.', 'We have a preference for steady. We like things predictable. We don’t want surprises. We’re careful in our decision making. The decisions we make have long term impacts. The capital investments we make are long lead time projects therefore we’re very disciplined in our capital deployment. By following these philosophies we’ve built a world class organization. We’re the world’s largest producer of phosphate and potash, a tremendous accomplishment. We are the most powerful combination of assets, talent, financial strength and global reach in the crop nutrition industry. There is nobody better. We’ve accomplished a great deal and almost none of that by accident. We’ve stated this number of times this afternoon.', 'This business, this industry is cyclical. Cycle is different than the equity market cycles you used to cycles more founded in agricultural cyclicality. We understand the broad spectrum of factors that influence our business for better and for worst. We know the weather and world’s agricultural geographies have a profound effect on the pricing of commodities, and we know that to be in predictable.', 'Commodity prices fluctuate wildly sometimes. Disruptive global and geopolitical events that happen in the world and even most recently market participants that act at what appears to be in opposition to their own economic best interest. You just can’t tell what’s going to happen next.', 'So that’s where it’s been so important in our strategy development that Mosaic can succeed in the deeps in the market as we’re experiencing now, that we can accelerate when we come up to the peaks and light up the troughs and find opportunities throughout the cycle, the good and the bad. And our results just demonstrate that we can do just that. Expect more from us but more steady prudent management and a willingness to seize opportunities when they present themselves, all with an unflinching commitment to generating solid returns for shareholders, our key strategic priority.', 'Mosaic’s future is bright. Regardless of the volatility we’re all facing, the markets bring on to us, our future is tied to the greatest challenge of our times, a challenge that will increase with the generations ahead and that’s feeding a growing planet. The world has to grow more food. There is no way around it; and a whole lot more food. Simply cannot do this without sound crop nutrition. And therein lies the value of Mosaic. This is an excellent franchise, built to withstand tough times and prosper through the good and the bad times, supported by the most compelling future demand story I know of, all materials in the world, food to help us survive.

Yes sir Susquehanna, Don Carson.', 'Don Carson - Susquehanna Financial', ""Thanks, Don Carson from Susquehanna. Jim a couple of questions on potash. The Russians cite their market share loss to Canpotex is one of the factors behind their decision to focus more on volume than price. So the question would be how will Canpotex respond? Do you collectively need to cut your volumes and take less share? And then specifically for Mosaic, why invest in so much potash capacity? I think you'll eventually be over 12 million metric tons when your own upside case is showing only 9.8 million metric tons. Aren't you better off putting more cash back into your own stock.""]",question_answer,MOS_57667
3100,Jim Prokopanko,"[""Okay, I'll answer the first question Joc and Larry could speak to the second one. The view in selling our potash is that we will take care of the customers that have grown to trust Canpotex. We have some customers around the world and some not insignificant ones that are 100% reliant on potash products. They've chosen to have the Canadian suppliers provide their product. We're sticking with those. They're going to be supplied with products and not be found to be at a financial disadvantage."", ""Growing market share, just speak to that, we're not out for a market share fight by any means and we don't have gain of market share as a goal or a strategy. What's happened this past year and I think it may have got caught up in the noise or people are looking for excuses, is that in a couple of markets of the world the bpc was struggling to get product to the market. In particular in Brazil there were some issues around, there was an early season in Brazil their past spring. Winter in Byelorussia, the northern Baltic ports were frozen in, locked in, they weren't able to get the product into position. So that demand went to Canpotex and other suppliers in the world."", ""It's not that Canpotex brought it through lower prices. It's just a matter of good marketing, strong relationship building and we're going to do it on that. We don't compete on price. We're competitive. We don't lead the price down. So, how we're going to behave in the future? We're going to ensure that our good selective customers are taken care of and they're not at a financial disadvantage. Larry, Joc, do you want to speak to why this led to where we're at with production capacity versus demand?""]",question_answer,MOS_57667
3101,Joc O'Rourke,"[""So, when we entered into these projects, it's now four to five years ago that we entered into the first three big ones which was the first stage of Esterhazy, Belle Plaine, Colonway and Cave 3. Obviously Cave 3 is a long term project for the future of Esterhazy and as Larry said in his presentation, a great future for Hazy. The other two projects, or the other two, Colonway and Belle Plaine are far enough along that getting food in now is the best prudent thing to do and what we've shown going forward though is the Belle Plaine stage 2, we've been quite prudent by saying we would hold that off until we thought the market needed it. But recognize also, you need a little bit of extra capacity because the market doesn't sell, every month. So the months they're shutdown and there's months where the production will be very low and so you do have to have a little bit of excess capacity in this business.""]",question_answer,MOS_57667
3102,Larry Stranghoener,"[""And where we do have, I'll just add one thing Don; where we do have there's flyups in the market. Things happen in this business, whether on the demand side or on the supply side, and we're going to be in a wonderful position that if there's a fly up, increased sudden demand, we'll be able to put our foot on the accelerator and produce that. Last time that happened in 2008, when we saw that run up, we hit the accelerator and the car stuttered. We were producing full out and even at that, we were scooping every last spoonful out of the mine. So well maybe we didn't pick the right year to get to these new plants up and running but it will be used.

3105,Rick McLellan,"[""Yes. It's a good question and one that we take a look at. I think that from what we can garner and the discussions we've have with dealers and farmers, expectations are for a normal, quite possibly larger than normal fall application period. I think that what people confuse is the primary looks of the economics of grain production, the chart that I believe Jim showed at the start, shows that the value the farmer's getting for his crop inputs versus the grain price are really quite solid and when you think about it, with the potash the farmer grows, potash could drop a $100 a ton. To the farmer that's about $0.70 a bushel. When they look at it, they're smart enough to figure out, it's about the economics, and the economics are, this is the time for them to get the product on so that in the spring they can focus on getting it in the ground.""]",question_answer,MOS_57667
3106,Jim Prokopanko,"['2008 was a lesson for everybody in this industry, particularly around risk management. So it’s a really matter of psychology now. The supply chain is just reluctant to put product in when you have somebody stating and now they’re trying to pull that back and retract. So we might see $300 or lower than $300 potash. Famers in Nebraska, palm plantation owners in Southeast Asia, they all heard that. They read that’s why I’m waiting $300 potash. I don’t think it’s going to happen.', 'And so people are just saying well, why should I buy it at $350 when maybe it will go 300. Nobody wants that chance but you get to a point and we’re going to be getting to that in a couple of weeks in the U.S. and Canada, farmers have to get their fall fertilizer on and they just can’t wait to see maybe another $50 or $25. It will be too late then. Dealers won’t have the product. It won’t be positioned. So that’s more about psychology as what’s holding up the market and plugged the market. It’s not the price.

So well access market circumstances at the time. As you know we are restricted from the doing anything until very late November. So we’ll access market circumstances at the time and then make a decision. But I’ll repeat what I said in my remarks where we were very committed to a meaningful shareholder distribution.

We believe that’s a competitive advantage for us and we don’t want to talk about it, but we done a lot with working with our customers on how they can capture and garner more value and we can too.

Around the time of the deal it sounded like you had moved away from wanting to expand distribution. So I’m curious if you can help us understand the evolution in that market. And separately with respect to Larry's comment on long term projections, I wonder if you would share with us your view on when Brazil's land conversion process slow down. I assume you have that somewhere in your projections. And when MPK ratios will peak out in Brazil?""]",question_answer,MOS_57667
3120,Jim Prokopanko,"[""I will just comment on what attracted us in the thinking on Brazil. We always believe in Brazil as a growing market and as a customer for potash and phosphate. And Cargill is down there lot of us have the pedigree that goes back and we understand what's happening in Brazil. Then we had a bit of a setback. When the business Fosfertil was sold in Brazil. Our partners Bunge and Yara sold at the Vale. It just was a deal that was going to happen and was directed that way. And so we left and try to get our feet under ourselves and since then we have remained confident that there was a place for us, a substantial place for us even without the base production assets."", ""What's happened over the last five or six years, is we’re seeing the agricultural zones continue to grow north. Six and seven years ago you have, the grain companies had a good footprint, the ADMs, the Cargills, the Bunges had good footprint. Now Bunge has left that market. They are just doing grain origination and non-fertilizer, they sold their assets. You are seeing this land grow up north, where there is not well served. The south was pretty well served with asset, with facilities, with grain elevators. And it was going to be hard to go in and not just have a market share fight to get that share."", ""I think we’re ahead of the other army that are going to go in, and we think we'll be the first in somebody's territories of course with our understanding of bringing grains in. The last couple of years has been a real suggestion to bring product into the country. We’re facing that. And as I said in my earlier comments, access to markets is becoming ever more important, to be able to bring product in and not wait 60 days at a port to unload a phosphate vessel.

The other piece that’s impacted this is you had, what’s happened with demand, and again potash has had this spillover effect on other products.', 'You’ve had more production capacity; you have one market, India that is 3 million tons less potash this year, 3 million tons less phosphate this year, and I think we are going to be past that. The election will happen. They are going to have to, just simply have to reform their subsidy program. Indian scientists say it, Indian agronomists, Indian fertilizer leaders say it. They will reform that, and we get back to 6 million tons of P&P going each into India. That’s going to tighten up these markets and I think we’re within a year of that happening. Yes, so we’re on this side.']",question_answer,MOS_57667

Could you also share with us given your current vision of margins, what the ROC might be on K3? And secondly I think for the first time I have heard you sort of imply that when K3 is fully on stream, some years down the road, K1 and K2 could be shut down and retired, somewhat like the Brunswick and the Atlantic Provinces.

And of course one of the great values of K3 is this optionality that it gives us, which is the second part of your question which Joc can address.']",question_answer,MOS_57667
3141,Joc O'Rourke,"['Actually Larry put that a good way. I would class it as optionality rather than a specific plan. These are nonrenewable resources. The K1 and K2 resources will be depleted at some point, at which time the natural progression will be to the K3 mine. That may be quite a ways down the road, but we have the option with K3 in place to accelerate that or de-accelerate it depending on what makes the best economic sense at that time.

We haven’t found one that works too, mutual beneficial to both parties. So at this stage we are not pursuing that. So it will be a normal market-type purchase, whether it’s a forward curve or spot buying but that can always change in the future, if we can find the counterparty that wants to make a different kind of deal.', 'And your question about the mining in Florida, it’s not going to impact our mining. The three new mines that we have in the permitting process are going to continue. This is going to be incremental tones we get from Ma’aden. So our plan is to continue to produce about 10 million tons of finished phosphates in Florida. To do that we are going to need all the—we are going to need the three mines permitted, approximately 16 to 17 million tons of ore that we extract annually will go into our processing facilities in Louisiana and Florida.', 'The result is we have to keep that 60 million ton rate. What historically has been the case with these assets is we’re permitted seven years out, eight years out, and we’ll continue that, keep enough permitted land to keep our Florida operations, Louisiana operations fully operating with of course the Peruvian rock that comes in.

The Canadian suppliers reliable contract integrity, quality of products, reliability of shipping, we get it done. And there is more surprises that comes to them from other suppliers.

This brings compelling opportunity for Mosaic and its employees, for our customers, for our communities, and perhaps most of all for our stockholders.', 'Mosaic made significant progress in 2013. We made important headway on our $3 billion spend in potash expansion projects. The K2 mine and mill expansion at our Esterhazy mine are complete and we are working to demonstrate the capacity. Our K3 mineshaft is progressing well and its headframe is now the tallest structure in the province of Saskatchewan.', 'Our plans provide for an increase in our annual operational capacity for finished product of approximately 5 million tons. We have deferred construction on projects that would provide approximately 2 million of these new tons, until construction costs and potash market conditions improve, which we believe will allow us to achieve higher returns on our investment.

And third, these two developments have occurred during the seasonally slow period, so distributors have had the luxury to wait to see how these events will play out. The net result is that distributors are cautious and have deferred purchases in the phase of softer prices and several market uncertainties.', 'Business conditions are tough. We knew these days will come and understanding the cyclical nature of our industry, we are well prepared for them. Our financial foundation is another important source of strength. Our $2 billion of surplus cash and significant debt capacity gives us meaningful flexibility to return capital to shareholders, invest for growth and fund our obligations.', 'Whether markets are good or bad, the Mosaic story does not change. We will continue executing the strategy we refined in 2012, because it is the right strategy for Mosaic.', ""I'll briefly touch on each of our priorities. First is, people. I strongly believe that we have assembled the most talented team in our industry and we intend to maintain this critical competitive advantage by maintaining and recruiting highly talented people all across our operations."", 'Next is growth. Our potash expansions will significantly increase our operational capacity. And over the long-term, our Saudi joint venture should enable us to further diversify our sources of phosphates and provide access to key markets.

We're currently working to secure our existing market access, increase our presence in key agricultural regions and enter promising new areas. For example, in Brazil, one of the very few regions of the world with new acreage being brought into production, we intend to invest up to $300 million on a number of projects to build, expand or acquire distribution facilities."", 'And finally is innovation. Our product innovation continues to differentiate Mosaic from our competitors. Our MicroEssentials fertilizer reached an 11% share of the North American phosphate sales in fiscal 2013, and it is gaining traction in other regions of the world. We will continue to deliver product technology that improves yields, while helping farmers take care of the environment.', ""And finally, shareholder value. We are always determined to deliver strong total shareholder returns, with a focus on execution and effective capital allocation. We have always managed Mosaic with a long-term view. Markets and weather and prices will change, and they will affect our quarterly results. But the global demand for food, the imperative for farmers across the world to produce higher crop yields, the steady increase in the earth's population, these trends will not change."", 'Mosaic is in an excellent position to help agriculture meet its daunting challenge and that bodes well for all our stakeholders.

3198,James Prokopanko,"['Well, good morning and thank you, Chris. Thanks for the introduction. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for the interest in Mosaic. Please note our Safe Harbor statement, so advise.', ""Well, let me start today by sharing with you our view of the phosphate and potash outlook, a headline-rich industry these days. Uralkali's announcement on July 30, obviously [royal] markets and changed the perception of the global potash industry. The subsequent high drama still dominates industry news today and continues to provide intriguing [theatre], but our assessment is that the market is overreacting to these developments."", ""Despite the incredible amount of analysis following the announcement, the break-up of BPC in our view does nothing to change long-term fundamentals. The long-term outlook remains positive for reasons I will highlight later and fundamentals and nothing else. We'll continue to drive the long-term outlook for both phosphate and potash."", 'That said, there is no denying that fundamentals for all three nutrients have weakened recently due to a combination of factors. Illustrating the weakened fundamentals, this Chart shows that prices for all crop nutrients have declined significantly during the last two years and long before the July 30 announcement for all major nutrients.', 'On the demand side, subsidy reductions by the Indian government have resulted in sharp increases in retail prices and significant decreases in phosphate and potash use. In addition, the agricultural commodity prices, although still elevated, have retreated from record highs last year due to the prospect of a larger global harvest this year.', 'On the supply side, several brownfield and greenfield projects are beginning to deliver new supplies to the market, and as we have noted before, supply grows in lumpy increments. A couple of years of demand growth maybe needed to fully absorb the new capacity. Finally, lower cost from some raw material such as natural gas and sulfur are helping to reduce the finished product prices.', 'Several factors have exacerbated the impact of weaker fundamentals during the last few months. First, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against most major currencies and especially the recent collapse of the Indian rupee has increased the local currency price of imported plant nutrients and pressured dollar denominated delivery prices in several key countries.', 'Second, the uncertainty caused by the breakup of BPC has frozen the global potash market and spillover to the two other plant nutrient markets. Third, these two developments have occurred during a seasonally slow period, so distributors have had the luxury to wait to see how these events will play out.', 'The net result is that distributors are cautious and have deferred purchases in the face of softer prices and several uncertainties. So in the near-term, as announced in the press release this morning, market conditions have caused us to lower our price and volume guidance.', 'For the third calendar quarter, we now expect potash volumes in the range of 1,450,000 to 1,650,000 tons with realized MOP prices in the range of $330 to $340 per ton. Gross margin rate is now expected to be in the low-to-mid 30% range.', 'The range for phosphate volumes is 2,600,000 tons to 2,800,000 tons with realized DAP prices in the range of $430 to $440 per ton. Gross margin rate is now expected to be in the mid-teens. We estimate our tax rate for the seven-month stub year to be in the low 20% range, including notable items.', ""Now, let's turn back to the fundamentals. Behind all the noise are strong demand prospects, but demand remains a tale of two hemispheres. The drop in Indian shipments has garnered most of the attention, but plant nutrient demand is outstanding in other regions where markets and global price signals are allowed to work."", 'For example, Brazil will import and use record volumes of phosphate and potash this year. North American phosphate shipment set a record in 2012-2013, and our team expects another outstanding fallout application season in North America. Global phosphate and potash shipments are projected to reach record or near record levels this year and then increase to record levels in 2014.', 'Profitable farm economics underpinned demand. Our affordability metric indicates that plant nutrients are historically cheap due to elevated commodity prices and declines in plant nutrient costs. So there is no surprise that the latest USDA estimate showed the U.S. net cash farm income will stay at extraordinarily high levels for the third year in a row.', 'Additionally, we estimate that distributors are destocking the large global pipeline this year. On-farm application appears strong, despite less than expected shipments in some regions. Even our Delhi, India team reports a decent season for farmers due to an outstanding monsoon this year and higher support prices for major crops. Swings in distribution channel inventories only amplify fundamental developments.', 'Finally, delayed purchases are expected to compress movement this fall and likely test transportation and logistics capabilities. Prices for nearly all major plant nutrients have declined to their lowest levels in about three years, but we believe these factors point to a bottom.', 'As I noted earlier, the events of the last few months have not changed our long-term outlook. The food story remains intact. We recently updated our long-term grain and oilseed forecasts. This indicates that annual global harvest will need to increase by about 350 million tons between now and the end of the decade in order to meet projected demand.', 'To put that in perspective, this increase is roughly equal to the combined and outstanding harvest of Argentina, Brazil and Canada in 2012. We call this the ABCs of our food story.', 'Our analysis shows that farmers will need to plant record area and reap record yields year-after-year in order to meet projected demand. More hectares and even higher yields will require more plant nutrients. In fact, with the help of our international distribution team, we recently updated our long-term phosphate and potash demand forecasts.', 'We project that global shipments of the main finished phosphates products will increase 2.8% per year this decade or from 58.7 million tons in 2010 to 77.8 million tons in 2020. In the case of potash, we forecast that MOP shipments will increase 2.9% per year this decade or from 52.6 million tons in 2010 to 70.3 million tons in 2020.', 'Based on these demand forecasts as well as our estimates of our operating capacities these Charts show a long-term global operating rates for the main finished products as well as myriad of potash markets. Projected rates -- operating rates do not hit the extraordinary peaks of last decade, but they also do not indicate a prolonged or deep cyclical downturn. Our conclusion is that they show a balanced and constructive fundamental outlook through the end of this decade.', ""Before I talk about Mosaic strategy, I feel compelled to respond to several mischaracterizations of both the global potash market as well as our operations. The first is how potash markets work. We've always maintained that potash prices are determined by supply and demand. A brief review of prices during the last couple of decades supports this assessment."", ""Second the economic rationale for legal export associations such as Canpotex's efficiency. Canpotex delivers value to member companies through cost savings from its world-class transportation and logistics operations as well as its best-in-class customer service from a specialized and experience sales and marketing staff. Finally, despite several industry cost curves published during the last two months, Mosaic's global scale potash operations are cost competitive, and I'll give you more background on that shortly."", ""Let's take a look at potash prices over time. This Chart shows that potash prices and margins were flat at low levels until about 2004. The prolonged period of low prices and margins was largely the result of the break-up of the former Soviet Union in 1991. These Chart show the collapse of domestic potash shipments and the new supply of product that flooded the market. The old adage that the cure for low prices is low prices and the cure for high prices is high prices, applies in the global potash market."", ""Potash fundamentals and prices began to change in 2003. In fact, global MOP demand surged 30% or 12.6 million tons between 2002 and 2007. High soybean prices coupled with the weak real, super charged Brazil's agricultural sector. High oilseed prices also drove the rapid development of palm oil production in Southeast Asia."", 'China and India, also made significant progress in achieving more balanced nutrient use during that period. The surge in demand coupled with atrophy supply capabilities from years of underinvestment in this sector caused the 2008 price spike.', 'I simply cringe when I read reports that attribute despite the production cutbacks. I can tell you that we were scooping every spoonful of potash out of the earth that we could in the order to meet raging demand. In fact, most of our customer complaints were not about prices, but rather delays in shipping product, because we simply could not keep pace with demand.', 'Industry and statistics indicate that other producers faced similar challengers. Fundamentals have changed and prices have moderated during the last years due to the slowdown in demand growth and the commissioning of brownfield capacity by several producers.', ""Finally, we believe several recent studies have mischaracterized our cost position. This Chart from the 2013 CRU cost study provides consistent estimates for all producers running at capacity, and we believe captures Mosaic's relative cost position on the industry cost curve."", 'For our fiscal year that ended on May 31, we produced 7.2 million tons of MOP at our three facilities in Saskatchewan and our average mine production cost was in the $125 to $135 per ton range. Treatment of freight and resource taxes as well as impact of the tolling agreement need to be considered in order to properly assess our cost position. Our costs are elevated due to approximately $240 million of annual brine management cost at our Esterhazy facility.', 'Excluding these, our costs are comparable to the average cost of other Saskatchewan producers, but are 15% to 20% greater than the average for FSU producers, who benefit from lower labor and lower energy costs. So our actual delivered cost last year, including brine management cost were in the $180 to $185 per ton range for sales to China and were in the $200 to $205 per range for sales to Brazil.', ""Our costs are as not as high as several recent estimates, but we recognize they are elevated relative to key competitors. We are identifying opportunities for improvement and we'll provide more details about these initiatives at our Analyst Day here in New York on October 7."", ""Bringing all of this together, there has been an overreaction to the BPC break-up announcement. But there is also no denying that near-term fundamentals have been weakened, given several supply and demand related factors. Our long-term outlook remains positive, underpinned by solid farm economics, and Mosaic's cost position is competitive even with the brine inflow costs."", 'So with that background, our strategy has not changed. We refined our priorities last year and we are executing well. We have five principal priorities. First is, people. We are investing people in people and most importantly their safety, so that Mosaic is a place where people want to build their carriers.', ""Second, in growth. We are investing heavily in growth, including our potash expansions and our joint venture in Saudi Arabia and while we're seeking other strategic growth opportunities. The own innovation, number three. Our MicroEssential product and its fast growing market share demonstrate our product innovation. We're also strongly committed to process innovation that saves money and increases our sustainability."", ""Fourth is, market access. We're consistently working to secure our existing market access and increase our reach to the global markets. If we execute well on all four of these priorities, shareholder value will follow."", 'Our financial foundation provides a meaningful competitive advantage. We have the cash and debt capacity to withstand tough times, meet our obligations and investor growth and to return capital to shareholders. As you all know, we are unable to purchase shares in the open market until after November 26 of this year. We wish we could be buying shares today.', ""All of our strategic priorities contribute to our goal, which is to generate strong total shareholder returns. We have the strongest combination of assets, financial stability, talent, global reach, and innovation in the crop nutrient industry. We're in excellent position to be the world's leading crop nutrition company."", ""With that, thank you for your attention. And I think I'm available to take a few questions.""]",management_discussion,MOS_57394
3199,Chris Parkinson,"[""Thank you, Jim. I'll just start off with a quick question based on your recent guidance cuts, particularly in the phosphate market. A lot of us have been paying attention to the situation in India, but looking at continued strength in Brazil, are there any other trends we should be looking at in particular pertaining to the third quarter, and what your expectations are for the balance of the year and into 2014?""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3200,James Prokopanko,"[""I think it's a -- you've identified the two key drivers. What is happening in India and that has a knock-on effect in that reduced Indian demand, largely driven by a distorting market subsidy system. Farmer support system has reduced the demand for phosphates. That in turn has dried up an important market for the Chinese, who have India as a prime market."", ""And that product that used to go to India from China is now going to Brazil. That's challenged the pricing in Brazil, but with that, we are expecting with the weaker real, strong soybean prices denominated in U.S. dollars, demand will be strong for the second crop that will be following the soybean. So, we look for outstanding industry fundamentals in Brazil this year and likely next year."", ""And then there will be the U.S. market this year, which is delayed in part because of a late developing crop, but when it does come, we think it's going to be a remarkable fall season in North America, and then beyond that, I don't have anything else to add. Maybe costs we're seeing, sulfur cost stable, ammonia cost stable-to-lower certainly from where they were a couple of months ago. So just don't be focused on the sale price. Understand that we've seen ingredient costs, sulfur, ammonia come down.""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3201,Chris Parkinson,"[""It's the view of one of your competitors that lower price will bring about a significant rise in potash demand. I think the number was something like 6 million tons. To what degree do you agree with this? And I guess kind of -- at what price do you see some of your larger customers coming back into the market in a bigger way?""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3202,James Prokopanko,"[""I don't share the -- it's our view, my view. I don't agree with that perspective. The potash market is a largely priced inelastic market, and certainly at the high-end, you might see some price elasticity, $800, $1,000. But certainly in the mid-range to lower-range, I don't think you're going to stoke more demand with $300 potash versus $400 potash."", ""It's all about the grain prices and certainly grain prices relative to fertilizer -- to potash prices whether $300 or $400 is very inducive to application of potash. So, I don't see a drop in prices as materially changing global potash demand in any one year or any one season, not at all."", ""And your second question was at what price do we see major customers coming back, I mean that's what you'd asked. I think this is great economic reason to apply potash. The market that's in question remains India, and with the Indian potash crop nutrient subsidy system, where nitrogen is heavily incented by a factor of virtually 3x to potash and phosphate."", ""I don't think you're going to see India come back to the traditional or historic potash demand of about 6 million tons until that subsidy program is resolved or adjusted. That won't happen, I don't believe, very unlikely it will happen before early or the first half of 2014 where we're awaiting Indian Federal election. The result would be if they change the subsidy system, they'd have to reduce the subsidy that they pay for nitrogen."", ""Nitrogen is a domestically produced product largely in India. Reducing the subsidy would be effectively increasing the price of nitrogen to farmers, and nobody is going to do that before an election. So, we just don't see any light at the end of that tunnel until next year."", ""Now, I think as the markets resolved and we understand what's happening in Eastern Europe with the potash producers, this is -- these prices -- this is an opportunity for anybody interested in long-term contracts to load up on potash, and we'll see if people don't miss that opportunity.""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3203,Chris Parkinson,"[""Question regarding your comments on the announcements and the (inaudible) at BPC. By your own graphs, you're suggesting that the potash utilization in some markets is going to remain 15% to 20% idled capacity supporting higher prices. In most markets that's not sufficient leverage if you will to support the very high margins that we see in the business. With that and in light of the fact that your demand must be pretty robust to absorb of all of the growth in production that's been announced, how do you reconcile that with no change in long-term fundamentals. Is it -- or maybe the direct question is, is it necessary for that capacity utilization to get pushed up into the 90s to support prices at or above where they are today?""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3204,James Prokopanko,"[""The important question you're asking, and it comes down to the understanding of what operational capacity is. Operational capacity in this industry is often established as the best you can produce, the most you can produce in a 90-day proving run, at least for Canpotex purposes, multiply that by four and you get your annual operating rates. So run it for 90 days, three consecutive months. The best you can do actually is you run it for four months. You see the best you can do in 90 days, that becomes your operational rate. Well, potash mines don't run like that."", ""So, we have adjusted operating capacities, say, look that's not real, you have at least one month turnaround at most mines and facilities, at least the one month to turnaround. So you don't operate a mine, although rate at a 100% capacity, you don't run it for 12 months, you run it for 11 months. Then you have unexpected, so at least 90% of what your operating rate is the effective capacity."", 'Running at that rate is like running at a 100% and that just is impossible. You take down unexpected outages, plant shut downs, power interruptions. These things do happen with mining operations, so I think running at 90% capacity is equivalent for an extended period of time is equivalent to running at a 100%.', ""So we see 85% to 90% operating rates. We're going to see strong-to-elevated prices. We get over 90% operating rates for any period of time I think we're going to have strongly appreciated potash prices. So it all comes down to what is that denominator, what is in fact the operating rates. And these operating rates were often established when that mine was built. So, we have an operating rate at Esterhazy that was established 50 years ago."", ""Any mining, any basic materials industry starts with high grading the product, you go to the richest deposit. Over time, capacity starts to decline. You get further and further away from the richest store body. So just by way of an example, when Esterhazy, our largest potash mine -- the largest potash mine, the largest underground mine in the world was established 50 years ago, we're lifting just under 3 tons of ore to produce 1 ton of MOP finished product."", ""Today, we are approaching 4 tons of ore to produce 1 ton of finished product, just making the point that these operating capacities, there is some fiction in them. They are not entirely accurate, and overtime those operating capacities just really aren't there. So I think we have a period of slack, absolutely, might be another 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, but I think we're going to get back into balance quickly, and I'm not too fussed by it, we'll get back there.""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3205,Chris Parkinson,"['I think anyone following Mosaic wants to hear you talk about Uralkali a little bit, so I want to just talk about that for a second. It looks like what happened in late 2012 was that Canpotex had a deal with China that spooked BPC, and then both Uralkali and Belaruskali, kind of started shipping out the back door, discipline was lost and here we are with first half results for Uralkali being down 40% on EBITDA and close to 20% revenue and pricing declines.', ""So it looks like they're going to try to get back the five points of share that they have lost to Canpotex in the first half of this year. Could you talk about the prospects for Mosaic in light of that market share grab back? And let's ask the magic question, do you think they're going to get back together and if they do who cares?""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3206,James Prokopanko,"[""Well, some of that replay of history is one interpretation in China with Canpotex responded to the pricing in the market. We've seen competitors that had access to overland rail into Northern China, very, very aggressive. That seems to be missing from the narrative one of the producers."", ""They were very aggressive to this day time moving about the 2,000 tons a month at ghastly low prices. Good, perhaps back -- net backs, but to world prices -- below world prices. So I don't agree with your replay of what the history was that they responded to Canpotex. Canpotex was being competitive in the marketplace and with seaborne shipments is our only access into China."", ""We are going to lose market share or they're going to grab market share back. It's my view and I spend a lot of time with the international customers. I was recently with a large group of them from Asia for about three or four days on a customer event. And there is nobody in the world that provides customer care, customer attention, contract integrity that does -- that's provided by Canpotex and its Canadian shareholders, producing shareholders. And the customers recognize that."", ""So going forward, we're going to standby our core key customers. We have many of them in Asia, we have some -- I was recently in Asia and visiting with one of the customers and with our sales rep to that customer, who was there when this palm plantation planted their first palm tree, 25 years, 27 years ago."", ""This person is 100% -- this large, large customer is a 100% Canpotex. They won't think for a minute going to the Russian producer, provided we're competitive. So we have core customers, not all our customers are core customers, some are transactional. But we are going to stick by our core customers and we are going to ensure that they are competitive and price -- market share will be where the market share is."", ""So third question BPC, are they going to get back together, I just -- I know as much as you do. I don't think a volume overprice strategy passes the economic sniff test to use more of a non-renewable resource to bring it to market at a lower price, greater volume, so that you earn less dollars. Somebody has to come and explain, pencil out that math to me."", 'I think what you want to do is maximize the price you can get for a product, to justify the kind of returns we need today for capital reinvestment and for a brownfield reinvestment to justify brownfield, you need a minimum of $300 a ton FOB mine price to justify a cost to capital return on investment.', ""For greenfield, which we're going to need a greenfield mine some time in the year 2020, 2023, you're going to need $600 a ton. So giving it away, I don't understand whose benefit it serves. It doesn't serve the shareholders purpose. It doesn't serve the enterprises purpose. You can't justify growth in the industry."", ""So I just don't see that what we have today is a one competitive strategy of volume overprice is sustainable for very long at all. And I think when the dust settles and within a year, we're going to find that there isn't much more potash sold, market shares haven't changed appreciably and somebody is going to have a lot of explaining to do.""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3207,Unidentified Analyst,"[""Jim, I think you made a very good case for the value of Canpotex, legal export association until the recent brouhaha with BPC however, it seemed like all the major world producers would come into line, when one big group negotiate a price with China or whatever, everyone else would seem to go in line with that. Does that mean, it's more than just Canpotex, is it export association or it's bigger than that or has there been any pressure from the authorities in Canada asking about this, just a curious?""]",question_answer,MOS_57394
3208,James Prokopanko,"[""So in Canada, it's a legal association under the laws of Canada, but there is similar kind of associations permitted in the U.S. and it is a collective marketing, and most importantly the collective logistic. So in Canada, there is tremendous support both at the federal and at the prudential level for the value that Canpotex brings and our customers like Canpotex. That says it all."", ""The customers that we have, our core customers know that we have contract integrality, know that most of the executives are free, walking around, traveling the world and not in some -- not under detention. They can meet with me in my office or in their office. They don't have to come on visiting day. Does that sense a lot, just think about it, you're going -- you are going to put your hand -- your food security for your country in the hands of a company that you don't know who owns it, you don't know the legal position of the chief executive and their staff."", 'Are you going to do business with people like that -- it just shake my head.

So lets call it, forget the ammonia plant, just take it out $2,000 -- $6 billion, $2,000 a capacity ton to develop a mine and a phosphate plant. We produce 10 million tons of phosphate a year."", ""To replace Mosaic's phosphate business, with 40 years proven probable reserves, it's going to cost you 10 million tons times $2,000 a ton, $20 billion. To build a new potash mine, it's costing at least $2,500 a capacity ton to build a new greenfield facility. We have 100 years of reserves at already. We produce and we'll with the finish our -- with the completion of the Esterhazy expansion, we'll be producing 13 million tons at $2,500 a ton, little hard amount, that's 26 plus 7, that's $30 billion."", ""So we have a $30 billion replacement value of potash, $20 billion replacement value of phosphate, $50 billion at distribution business worth of couple of billion. Goodwill, talented staff, trained people and $3.5 billion on our balance sheet, we're $60 billion enterprise and it's trading at $20 billion -- under $20 billion, that just doesn't make sense."", ""So if you're looking for an investment for the next three and four months, well you can throw the dice. If you're looking for an investment that you can be confident that over the next three, five, 10, 15, 20 years is going to be secure -- value is going to be realized, it's going to be in Mosaic."", ""You can't replace Mosaic today for under $60 billion and for to be trading at $20 billion that's a real frustration and that's the way the market spoke and that's what they say.

3213,James Prokopanko,"['Good morning. Welcome to our fiscal fourth quarter and full year earnings discussion. Mosaic delivered a great fourth quarter. Thanks in part to a very strong albeit late and compressed spring application season in North America, as well as record Canpotex shipments. Demand for our products remains strong in many parts of the world with the exception of India. This morning I will review the quarter and the fiscal year then Larry will provide guidance and an update on our capital spending. And then before we take your questions, I will discuss our outlook for the coming year.', ""We would like you to take away three key messages today. First, Mosaic continues to execute and deliver solid performance, quarter after quarter. Second, we have completed a great year of progress in fiscal 2013. And finally, Mosaic remains in excellent position to achieve our vision of being the world's leading crop nutrition company. Let's start with the fiscal fourth quarter."", 'We reported operating earnings of $621 million on net sales of $2.7 billion. Both down compared with a year ago due to lower prices for potash and phosphates. The potash business unit contributed $445 million of operating earnings and the phosphates business unit contributed $198 million. In total, we reported earnings per share of $1.14, compared with $1.19 a year ago, an outstanding outcome in light of external factors.', 'We generated $855 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and we continue to maintain a strong cash position with $3.7 billion of cash on hand. Those numbers don’t tell the full story. It was a tough spring planting season for farmers here in North America. Warm weather came very late and just six months after drought battered the 2012 crop, the spring of 2013 brought [thrashing] rains to most of the Corn Belt. Some of the same fields that our ploughed under for lack of rain last year were puddled and too wet for planting this year.', ""The Mississippi River, once so dry that navigation nearly came to a halt, was again difficult to navigate this time because of flooding. Despite the logistical challenges, Mosaic's excellent execution allowed us to have product where it was needed to be for a very compressed and late application season in North America. In fact, we sold 2.6 million tons of potash, a record quarter for Mosaic. And 2.9 million tons of phosphates with a big finish in the last two weeks of May."", 'Shipments were also strong outside North America. We delivered record shipments to Brazil. We have reached an agreement on phosphate contracts with customers in India. And Canpotex had its best March through May period ever due to high volumes to China and Brazil as well as strong potash shipments to Southeast Asia. The strong demand led to high operating rates in our facilities. Our potash mines operated at 95% of capacity, while the phosphates operating rate was 85% of capacity.', ""As we have always said, markets determine prices and potash and phosphate prices were lackluster for two market driven reasons. First, India continues to use significantly less potash than it has in recent history, offsetting demand growth elsewhere. As a result of the nation's unbalanced subsidy program, Indian agricultural soil is suffering and at some point the subsidies will need to change to avoid increasing pressure on the food supply. India will come back, we are just not certain when."", 'Second, additional supply is expected to come on the market with China and Saudi Arabia providing some new phosphate tons, and potash expansions coming online in Canada and Russia. We expect this softness which is exacerbated by the weak Indian rupee to continue over the near term. We have often said that volumes increase first followed by prices, and we expect that trend to continue. We have experienced two years without volume growth until now, volume is growing again. That demand growth will absorb supply and at some point prices will follow.', 'That said, North America upcountry prices held up well during the quarter, in part because of the logistical challenges posed by the weather. We were able to overcome those challenges with our final price deferred arrangements with some customers. These arrangements allow customers to fill their bins early and then price this inventory closer to when the product is sold. Mosaic and our customers jointly capture value at the point of retail sale, which has created significant goodwill and customer loyalty. It also enables us to maintain our production at an efficient and steady rate because it can move product to retailers before their customers are demanding it.', 'Beyond our excellent fourth quarter performance, the longer term outlook remains positive. Farmers still have strong incentive to maximize yield. And to maximize yield, they need fertilizer. Grain and oil seed prices have declined in anticipation of a big crop, which would be a welcome development for global food security. But prices remain high enough to deliver good farm profits, especially given the affordability of crop nutrition and other inputs. And let’s not forget that farmers balance sheets and cash flows remain exceptionally strong as a result of many years of compelling economics.', 'Farmers can make a good living even if corn prices drift down to $4.50 or even $4 per bushel, especially if they’re wringing more bushels out of each acre. Revenue per acre matters to farmers and there are a lot of ways to generate a profitable $900 of revenue per acre. So as farmers push for better yields, Mosaic can in turn generate strong returns even with lower grain and oil seed prices. One further note on grain and oil seed prices. We do not expect prices to suffer dramatically. Just as $7 corn did strong by destroying demand last year, we expect lower prices to unleash significant pent up demand for grain and oil seed this year, which should raise the floor under prices.', 'So to summarize our fiscal fourth quarter. Mosaic once again delivered on its promises and expectations. We executed well, mitigating the impact of extraordinary circumstances which enabled us to produce results that were in line with our guidance. I am very proud of what our team accomplished. We manage the company for long term success and our consistent quarterly performance is evidence of this focus.', 'Now, I will step back and talk about our full year. We made great progress throughout our fiscal year. Despite a tumultuous period marked by wild weather swings, shifting government policies and significant volatility in agricultural commodity prices, Mosaic took big steps forward while generating steady, solid results. I’d like to recount some highlights. Our first priority is the safety of our employees. I’m proud to report that we set another record for safety performance in 2013, which is a reflection of our operational excellence. We achieved a 6% improvement in our key safety measures and that comes on the heels of record performance in 2012. We made good progress on our Potash expansion projects, which remained on budget and on time. In Potash, we started to see the economic benefit of the tolling agreement reversion, which increased our allocation of Canpotex by 6 percentage points.', 'The Saudi joint venture is proceeding well. The next step is the signing of a shareholders agreement. When production begins likely in late 2016, the project will be an important new source of low cost phosphate fertilizer for us. We extended our market leadership in innovative, yield enhancing crop nutrition products. Mosaic’s MicroEssentials phosphate product continued to gain market share in North America, Brazil and elsewhere. In fact, shipments were up 28% year over year. We plan to increase our production capacity to meet the strong demand for MicroEssentials.', 'In Florida, our South Fort Meade mine returned to full productivity, helping us generate phosphate rocks at lower cost. We received the Army Corps of Engineers Area-wide Environmental Impact Study regarding our phosphate acreage in Central Florida. We believe the AEIS report is a positive stepping stone as we work towards new mine permits.', 'Finally, we established and communicated explicit philosophies for capital management as part of our strategy to deliver strong shareholder value. That’s quite a year and we accomplished all these things while generating $1.9 billion in cash from operations, $2.2 billion in operating earnings and $10 billion in net sales.', 'Now, I’ll turn the call over to Larry. After he provides further discussion of our capital plans and our guidance, I will conclude with a walk of the remainder of 2013 and beyond. Larry?']",management_discussion,MOS_53300
3214,Lawrence Stranghoener,"['Thanks Jim and good morning. We’ve talked to you frequently in recent months about our capital philosophy, so rather than reiterate all that information, I’ll provide a couple of relevant updates. First, we have had discussions regarding the Class A shares held by the Margaret A. Cargill Trust and Cargill family members. As we announced in a news release on June 25, Cargill Incorporated has elected not to allow the amendment of agreements that would have permitted accelerated share repurchases, and the trusts have elected to forego their right to demand a secondary equity offering at this time. It is our intention to pursue share repurchases or repurchases combined with the secondary offering, after November 26 of this year when we are no longer governed by split off related restrictions.', 'We continue to target mid-2014 to hit our stated balance sheet objectives, which include an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5 times and a liquidity buffer of $2.25 billion. Second, we are planning to access the debt markets when conditions are right. It is reasonable to expect the bond offering during the second half of 2013 to take advantage of historically attractive debt market conditions.', 'Now I will turn to guidance. We are delighted this is the last time we will be reporting under the May 31 fiscal year-end. As I am sure you are aware, we will change our fiscal year-end to December 31, and are currently in a 7-month stub period. Beginning with this call, we will provide quarterly and annual guidance on a calendar basis so the quarterly guidance I will go through now is intended to cover July through September of this year.', ""One final note on our fiscal year change. We intend to release our historical financial results recast on a calendar basis in September when we will provide results for calendar quarters going back to the first quarter of 2012. Our price and volume guidance reflects Jim's comments. This has been a year of volume recovery with prices impacted by a number of factors including the Indian rupee's weakness, contract negotiations with China, and generally cautious customer behavior. We expect strong volumes to continue and as Jim said, we expect prices to follow when these market issues are resolved."", 'For the third quarter of calendar 2013, we expect potash sales volumes to be in the range of 1.8 to 2.1 million tons compared with actual volumes of 1.8 million tons in the same period of last year. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $330 to $360 per ton. The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the mid to high 30% range. Our upgrading rate in potash during the third calendar quarter is expected to be below 75%, which is lower than the last quarter due to planned seasonal maintenance turnarounds and a curtailment of production at our Colonsay mine. We may also curtail at other mines if required to match our production volumes to market demand for our products.', ""Brine management expenses are expected to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million for the quarter, and Canadian resource taxes and royalties will be in the range of $60 million to $80 million. In phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.9 million to 3.3 million tons for the third calendar quarter compared to 2.9 million tons in last year's period. We expect our realized prices for DAP to range from $430 to $465 per ton. Mosaic's phosphates operating rate is expected to be in the mid 80% range during the third calendar quarter."", 'I would like to draw particular attention to our phosphates gross margin rate guidance. We expect the gross margin rate to be above flat with the quarter we reported today. We expect the decline in prices to be offset by lower raw material cost, though we do have some higher cost inventory to work through. The phosphate margin is one element of our guidance that seems to have been frequently misinterpreted, but I would note that we have been very consistent. Our reported gross margin rates have consistently fallen within our guidance range.', 'Also for the third quarter, we estimate SG&A expenses will be approximately $95 million to $105 million. For the seven months stub period, we estimate an effective tax rate continuing in the mid-20% range and capital expenditures and investments in the range of $900 million to $1.1 billion. Please note that our investment in the Saudi joint venture is not included in the capital expenditure line on the cash flow statement.', 'Now I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.']",management_discussion,MOS_53300
3215,James Prokopanko,"['Thanks Larry. The outlook is promising for Mosaic. Internationally, we expect continuing strong shipments of both Potash and phosphate to Brazil, and we are optimistic about shipments to China. While a good monsoon season is likely to lead to a better than average crop in India, the nation will ultimately be healthier, more productive soils. When the government balances the subsidy program again, demand for our products in India should be quite strong. After all, the Indian population is growing by 18 million people per year, which obviously increases demand for agricultural inputs and foodstuffs.', 'Strong farm economics and ever increasing demand for grain and oil seeds underpin our expectations of robust demand for our products in the years to come. The long run of good farm economics is leading farmers around the globe to invest in higher yields and plant more acres. These developments are all very good for Mosaic’s future. All soil needs nutrients.', 'As our guidance makes clear, we do not expect a significant recovery in potash and phosphate prices in the near term. Over the medium and longer term, we ultimately believe that economics will rule. The new supply of both nutrients that is coming to market now is likely to dampen prices and lower prices will lead to less future supply expansion. We have already seen a number of announcements deferring or canceling projects. New supply will continue to come in stair step fashion, resulting in short term periods of imbalance which we are seeing today. We are confident that over the next year or two, demand growth will ultimately absorb the new supply.', 'At Mosaic, we expect to capitalize on the strong, long term opportunity by executing our strategy and seeking new ways to roll. I’d like to provide a few highlights of our future. We are taking a number of actions to grow both our business and our earnings. Our new potash capacity is expected to lead to volume growth and stronger cash flows. Our Saudi joint venture will enable us to expand our production of low cost phosphate and supply to important growing agricultural markets. And we’ll continue to look for value adding business development opportunities, both joint ventures and acquisitions.', 'In Brazil, where the future of agriculture is bright, we’re making a significant new investment to expand our presence. Over the next five years, we intend to spend approximately $300 million on a number of projects to build, expand or acquire facilities. We will provide more details about our Brazil strategy this fall at our October 7 Analyst Day in New York. We also intend to extend our innovation lead. We expect to continue to grow our market share for our higher margin premium products and we will continue to find better, cheaper, more sustainable ways to operate.', 'Finally, we are constantly striving to deliver strong shareholder value. We are committed to improving the efficiency of our balance sheet and returning capital to investors. We’re maintaining our goal of achieving our balance sheet objectives by mid-2014. These initiatives, along with our consistently excellent execution foretell a promising future for Mosaic. That’s good for us. It’s good for investors and it’s good for the world.', 'The globe’s population is rising and the growth is concentrated in the developing nations. You know the numbers by now. 75 million more people to feed each year, 2 billion more by 2050, nearly 1 billion more in Africa alone. And as those developing economies make progress, their citizens will demand more nutritious food which in turn requires even greater agricultural production. As an example, the Guardian recently reported that China’s meat consumption has increased fourfold in just 20 years. That’s 1 billion people multiplying their meat consumption by four in two decades, thanks mostly to China’s rising economic fortunes. We can expect that China will continue this trend and that other nations will make a similar leap as their prosperity improves.', ""Is agriculture up to an enormous challenge? We believe it is, and we know it's going to require a lot of phosphate and potash. Croup nutrition is responsible for up to 60% of croup yields and the world clearly needs higher yields. Mosaic is in a great position to help the world's farmers meet the challenge and help the world grow the food it needs."", 'Now we would be happy to take your questions.']",management_discussion,MOS_53300

The second is that we’ve seen pressure in markets around the world, whether it be Brazil where we’ve seen prices come off higher levels to getting down closer to $400 a ton for import levels and the same thing into [slot] markets, Malaysia and Indonesia we’ve seen price pressure.

3233,James Prokopanko,"['Good morning, P.J. I will discuss the first question about India and then have Mike Rahm talk about the China question. You’re absolutely right. This has been a very market distorting subsidy program that the Indian government has in place. You’re seeing -- we’ve seen prices on both DAP and on potash nearly triple over the last 18, 24 months, while there has just been a couple of rupees increase in the price of urea. So the Indian farmers have looked at that and their thinking is, flawed as it may be, but their thinking is, we’ll just put on twice as much urea and reduce our potash and phosphate. This will catch up to them. This is not good for the crop production, the balance of nutrition that those plants need and it’s not good for the environment.', 'We have little doubt that that will be adjusted in the coming months. The time frame on that will not likely be before the May, I think it’s May 2014 federal elections and national elections in India. The Indian government to make this right will have to increase or decrease I should say the subsidy paid for nitrogen fertilizers and that means the price of nitrogen fertilizer will go up for the Indian farmers and no official in India that’s looking to be reelected is going to dare raise the price on urea which is domestically produced and a staple for the Indian farmer.

In Brazil we’ve seen prices slip from highs of $20 to $30 a ton and those highs were in the April, May period. So that’s where we’re seeing a bit of price pressure around the world. And right now it’s manageable and as Jim said earlier, we expect this reflects what the bottom is to the marketplace. And the second question was on blend and feed pricing. Feed pricing is on -- I’ll start there, is on contract pricing for a quarter. And so the prices there were fixed at the start of the quarter. So it didn’t reflect any kind of pricing pressure and it follows through.

I hope you find it of interest. We are going to go into a bit more background about the company than we normally would do because my assumption is that perhaps we are not quite as familiar to many of you as we would be in typical conferences in the US.', 'So let me begin. Starting with our Safe Harbor of course. As Matthew said, we were formed as a new entity in 2004. We are the product of a split spin-off of Cargill’s Crop Nutrition business. As I think you might know Cargill is one of the largest private companies in the world. In 2004, they spun-off their crop nutrition business. It was about a $2 billion business. They merged it with IMC Global, another $2 billion business to create the Mosaic Company.', 'I am proud to say I was Mosaic’s first employee. I didn’t come from Cargill, I didn’t come from IMC. As Matthew described, I came from outside of the company. I have no idea what I was getting myself into, because we were born with way too much debt with very poor financial controls and processes, very poor systems, but we got the right people in the right place and created a great company.', 'Today, we are one of the largest fertilizer companies in the world. We have recently been spun-off from Cargill. Cargill after the creation of Mosaic, retained a two-thirds ownership stake, just about exactly two years ago, we undertook a transaction whereby they spun-off all of their two-third stake.', 'They did this for state planning purposes, fairly acute state planning purposes that they faced and we are now a fully independent company with far more flexibility to create our own future path. It also results in some interesting opportunities coming up this summer when the tail-end of this Cargill transaction takes place and I’ll describe more about that in a few moments.', 'Our mission is a very powerful and a noble one. We help the world grow the food it needs. It’s a mission that all of us at Mosaic take very, very seriously. And it’s a great motivator for our employees. Our vision is to become the world’s leading crop nutrition company.', 'Today, we are the world’s leading combined producer of phosphate and potash, as you might know there are three major crop nutrients, all crops need them to grow, nitrogen, phosphate and potash. We are by far in a way the largest producer of phosphate and one of the largest producers of potash in the world.', 'We deliver 19 million tons of products to customers in 40 different countries annually. We have a global footprint with facilities around the world. We have, as we say feet on the ground in key markets such as China and Brazil and India and elsewhere in the world. Our primary production facilities are in Canada, where we produce potash and in Florida in the United States where we produce phosphate.', 'Our vision outside is to be the world’s leading crop nutrition company and we’ll determine that as judged by our customers by the communities in which we operate by our employees and of course by our shareholders. Let me describe each of our businesses in a little bit more detail. We have five potash mines. Our three largest and primary mines are in Saskatchewan, Canada with two smaller facilities in the United States.', 'Our Esterhazy mine is the largest underground potash mine in the world. Our Belle Plaine mine is the largest solution mine in the world. Just to provide you with a little bit of context about the scale of these operations. If we are operating at peak capacity every day, we are moving 28,000 tons of product and equivalent of more than 250 rail cars of product per day.', 'We are in the process of expanding our potash capacity in Canada. We are two-thirds of the way through the first three million tons of an announced 5 million ton expansion program, you may be aware that just last week announced the postponement of the additional two million tons due to escalating capital costs; we’ll revisit that decision in the next year or two.', 'Potash is known as the regulator nutrient. It helps crops weather poor conditions such as drought. Potash is a salt; it’s a potassium carbonate bearing ore. Potash typically is mined deep underground. It’s a relatively simple mining process. It’s a relatively clean mining process. I suspect you’d be fascinated to visit our mine in Esterhazy where if you go underground 3000 feet, you’ll discover a city that extends 11 miles in one direction, 17 miles in another direction.', 'Global deposits of potash are well known. They are located in Canada and in Russia for the most part. As you see hereby on the slide, demand for the product has been a bit choppy over the last five or six years. We however look at this year as being a year of record shipments for potash. We are looking for a total of 55 million to 57 million tons of shipments. And we think we are on a path to grow this business, the market by 2.5% to 3% per year.', 'Our phosphate as said is located primarily in Florida. We’ve got a terrific complex of mines and chemical processing plants in Florida, unlike potash, the production of phosphate fertilizers are more complex process. It consists of mining phosphate rock which is the key value driver in the business.', 'At the same time, we produce sulfuric acid. We react the phosphoric rock with sulfuric acid to create phosphoric acid – excuse me. We then granulate that with ammonia to complete to make finished phosphate products known as DAP and MAP and we have just under 10 million tons of production per year.', 'We are a very low-cost producer in an industry that’s characterized by a very steeply sloping cost curve. We are at the very tail end of that cost curve.', 'In addition to our operations in Florida, where again we tightly coordinate our mines, our chemical plants in combination with a deepwater port that gives us access to markets around the world. We also have facilities in Louisiana with good access to Mississippi River and we have recently invested in a mine in Peru to give us access to more phosphate rock.', ""And most recently, we are very pleased to announce that we’ve entered into a joint venture to participate with Ma'aden in Saudi Arabia in a new 3 million ton phosphate production facility.

The US has very large deposits. We have probably 30 to 35 years of reserves in the United States. Most phosphates reserves are found in abundance stretching from North Africa, Morocco in particular through the Middle East including Saudi Arabia. There are also deposits in Russia and in China.', 'As you see on the chart, over the last number of years, there has been fairly steady demand growth in phosphates and we expect demand to continue to grow at a rate of 2% to 2.5% per year. Our values of integrity, excellence, sustainability and connectivity are reflected in all we do are very values-driven organization.', ""We are very proud of the fact that we have gained significant external recognition for corporate responsibility including the fact that we’ve been ranked in Corporate Responsibilities Magazine’s top 100 companies, three years in a row now, not bad for an eight year old company and Ethisphere Institute recently named Mosaic one of the World's Most Ethical Companies in 2012.

We are about $25 billion in market value at our recent price of about $60 to $61 per share. With the Cargill transaction, we are now a liquid stock. 2.5 million shares trade per day. I’ll tell you in a moment, we think we are about to become more liquid because of some further transactions coming up. We have a dividend yield of about 1.6%. We look forward to growing our dividend in line with earnings growth overtime.', 'And we have, I think unquestionably the best balance sheet, the biggest balance sheet in the industry. We’ve acknowledged in fact that’s an inefficient balance sheet. We intend to become a more – we should have a more efficient balance sheet, which I’ll tell you more about in a few minutes.', 'Most importantly, Mosaic stock is leveraged to what we think is one of the more compelling long-term investment stories in the world, that being the food story. And, perhaps many of you are aware of this, but the food story is a story that’s going to be with us for many, many years.', 'It’s based on the fact that population is growing by some 75 million people per year. Diets are improving in many parts of the world, increasing demand for protein. All of this underlies very steady growth and very predictable growth in grain and oil seed demand.', 'At the same time, there is very little new arable land to come into production. And so, to get the yields that are going to be needed to feed the world, farmers around the world are going to have to look to improve seed technology, better irrigation prospects, - better irrigation and better crop nutrition practices and that puts us squarely in a key role to play in this food story.', 'To put this in some perspective, this is a data point that I still think should be fact check, but even if it’s only half right, it’s an eye catcher and that is, in order to feed this growing world, to feed this growing population to meet the demands for better diets. The world is going to need to grow as much food in the next fifty years as its grown in the last eight thousand years, that puts some perspective on this food challenge that we have and fertilizer of course is going to play a critical role in meeting this food need.', 'So with that as a backdrop, let me go into our strategic priorities and tell you how Mosaic will fulfill this mission of helping the world grow the food it needs. We spent quite a bit of time last year doing a deep dive on our strategic direction. This was appropriate in light of the divestiture of the Cargill’s stake. We certainly had far more strategic flexibility. We will soon have far more financial flexibility, and so we spent a great deal of time with outside advisors and looking at our strategic direction.', 'And we started with the premise that Mosaic is good at a lot of different things. We are a very large mining company with expertise in surface mining, shafts mining, solution mining and so we considered using that expertise to move into other kinds of mining. We are a very large chemical processing plant company with great expertise in chemical processing.', 'We considered getting into to other kinds of chemicals. We are a very large agricultural company. We know agriculture. We know farmers. We know farming. It’s in our DNA. We thought about getting into other kinds of agricultural services. We considered all of these in the context of this food story we talked about, in the context of other emerging mega trends.', 'In the end, we concluded that we are in a very good place sticking to our knitting. Being in the crop nutrition space, we concluded it’s the best place to be in terms of returns on capital, in the agricultural industry and we further concluded that being in P and K specifically are the best places to be in the crop nutrition real.', 'And so, we happily concluded that what we are doing is exactly what we should be doing and so in effect we are doubling down on what we are best at. Phosphate and potash and we want to be known as a crop nutrition company.', 'Our strategic priorities revolve around the notion of course of creating value for shareholders, shareholder return is one of our stated priorities, but we know that in order to create value for shareholders, we need to do a number of things well. And specifically, we need to invest in people. We need to g row the business.', 'We can grow partly through innovation and we need to ensure we’ve got market access for the products that we produce. We also think that financial philosophy is a key role in creating value for shareholders. Last week, as many of you may have heard, we outlined our financial management philosophy. I’ll talk more about that, but that also has a key role to play in creating shareholder value.', 'So, let me talk in turn about each one of these priorities of people growth, innovation, and market access. We do believe, perhaps with not much humility that we’ve got the best people in the industry. We will target this. We do think talent makes a difference.', 'One mark of this is that we’ve got the best safety record of any of our peers and we are often confounded by the fact that investors don’t seem to care about safety and yet I tell you should care about safety and I’d urge you when you are meeting with companies, especially in capital goods industries ask exact it is about their safety mindset.', 'It will tell you a lot about how good they are at operational excellence and how much they really care about their key resources, their people. That’s a key focus for us and we think it’s evidence of our excellence with respect to operational excellence. We are one of the few companies in the industries that can boast of a true track record of innovation. I’ll talk more about that that clearly is a reflection of the talent we have. We will continue to make investing in talent as top priority for our organization.', 'One interesting tidbit on this. We are good at moving people around. One of our most successful phosphate mines is our Four Corners Mine which h has been especially successful in the last couple of years in response to some challenges we’ve had with permitting new mines in Florida.', 'We recently moved the manager of that mine to head our Esterhazy Mine in Canada. And so there has been one remaining but he would move from Florida to Esterhazy Canada. You might ask, well, what is phosphate mining have to do with potash mining and the fact there is not a heck of a lot and yet this is all about leadership. So we moved a true leader, somebody who would exhibit the strong leadership capabilities in our phosphate mine to our Esterhazy mine and he is making a world of different set at that mine as we speak.', 'Ultimately, we want Mosaic to continue to be known as a company where people want to work and grow as individuals. So it’s a key strategic priority. The second key priority is growth and probably too many of you the most important priority. We understand that we need to grow cash flow and we are working on all of the levers of cash flow growth. Whether it’s top-line growth, whether it’s margin improvement, whether it’s working capital management, whether it’s the tax rate or capital expenditures, these are the five key cash flow drivers and we are working on all of them.', 'One of the key growth strategies that we have, as already said is the potash expansion program. We’ve got plans to add 5 million tons, nearly a 50% increase in capacity. We are being a little bit measured in the pace at which we do that. Ultimately, the world will need these tons. We can bring on this capacity at a much lower cost than any new Greenfield entrant to this industry could do. So this is going to be a key source of growth for us going forward.', 'And I am happy to say that the current projects underway are all on-time and on-budget. We have opportunities to expand our margin rate in the potash industry. We’ll recognize, we are not quite as good as the leading player in the potash industry. Our objective is to become the leading margin performer in the potash industry and we are working to accomplish that.', ""In the phosphate business, we don’t have the same sort of internal growth opportunities that we have in potash because we don’t have quite the extensive reserve base of ore in phosphate that we do had in potash nonetheless, we do have growth opportunities externally the Ma'aden joint venture, our joint venture in Saudi Arabia is an example. Further, we’ve got great opportunities to grow the value of this business by focusing on improved margins and improved asset efficiency and we are doing that."", 'One of the unique margin improvement opportunities in front of us right now is the possibility of investing in a new ammonia plant not to get into the merchant ammonia market but, we require 1.5 million tons of ammonia per year to produce 9 million tons of phosphate fertilizer.', 'We currently produce about a third of our needs ourselves at a cost of about $200 a ton of ammonia. We purchase the other 1 million tons at a price of about $600 a ton. So, we think it may will make sense for us to spend the capital to capture this margin differential, of course, we’ll need to make a determination as to whether that margin differential is likely to persist in the future. But it’s under active consideration as we speak. If we go ahead, if we have done this a few years ago, we would have captured five incremental points of gross margin our phosphate business.', 'The third priority is market access. I think this is an underappreciated part of our strategy. We are unique in our industry and that we are both a producer as well as we have distribution capabilities, wholesale distribution capabilities in key markets around the world.', 'Brazil is one area in particular, where we think that our ability to continue to have access to that market for our own produced products depends upon our ability to have port facilities, blending and bagging facilities, supply chain capabilities. And so we are investing on the order of hundreds of millions of dollars over the next few years to grow our distribution capability in Brazil and we’d look for similar opportunities in places like India and China if that were to make sense.', 'Distribution is not – we don’t think an attractive business in and of itself and so this needs to be understood in the context of being primarily a producer and ensuring again access to markets or the product that we produce.', 'Finally, the fourth strategic priority is innovation. I mentioned, we are one of the more innovative companies in the world. The evidence of that is a product called Micro Essentials. In our phosphates business, we have developed a proprietary technology whereby we embed so-called micronutrients essential nutrients for some soils, for some crops such as sulfur, zinc, boron.', 'We’ve developed a way to embed granules of those micronutrients into a granular phosphate fertilizer allowing a much more efficient distribution of those crop nutrients on fields and it provides farmers with a decided yield advantage to the tune of about 5% to 7% which translates into big dollars, which translates into a little value opportunity for us to sell what otherwise would be a commodity product at a higher price.', 'Today, we produce 25% of the phosphate products we produce are MES and we’ve got the capacity – we’ve got the ability should we choose to pursue it to convert as much as 50% of our phosphate production capability to MES overtime and we are evaluating whether or not that makes sense.', 'This is a product in high demand today despite the price premium. When I go to visit customers which isn’t as often as it should be, but one constant refrain I get is, can we get more MES. We are selective in who we allow to have it, but it is a very, very successful product, not only in North America, but in some other regions of the world.', 'We are also focused on process innovation. We are investing to reduce electricity usage in the phosphate business which is a very intense electricity user and so that will continue. That’s a further margin enhancement opportunity for us. And across the board, we look for process innovation to improve our cost structure and we are showing evidence of achieving those objectives.', 'So now just a few words about our capital management philosophy. I told you this is another key part of our TSR objectives. We have built, very deliberately a very big balance sheet and without getting into more detail than you care to, the tail-end of this Cargill transaction will happen now in the next number of months.', 'So as a result of that transaction, 129 million of our 425 million shares are held by a charitable trust and various Cargill family members who exchanged Cargill shares from Mosaic shares. Those shares have been locked up. Those lock-ups begin to expire this summer.', 'And so, we have built this balance sheet in anticipation of our desire to buy back some of those shares rather than having them come to the market. And so, we have indicated a willingness to move to a more efficient balance sheet with a primary objective in doing so to buyback a number of shares, returning capital to shareholders.', 'More specifically today, or at least by the end of our fiscal year which ends in - I guess next week, we think we have roughly $2 billion of surplus cash and at a targeted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of $1.5 billion, we would have $3 billion of debt capacity. So $5 billion of capacity that we are eager to put to use with a primary objective to use a significant portion of that $5 billion for share buybacks.', 'Should we be able to reach agreement with these shareholders with the shares that are coming off lock-up, complex transaction, I hope I conveyed the primary message, which is we look forward to returning capital to shareholders soon via a share buyback.', 'Finally, if we execute well on these strategic priorities that we have if we continue to pursue this vision of becoming the best crop nutrition company in the world, if we execute on our capital return objectives, we think we are in a position to deliver very strong value to our shareholders. We’ve got a great set of assets. We’ve got a great work force. We think we’ve got the discipline needed in this industry to execute on these priorities appropriately and so we see a very attractive investment opportunity for our shareholders and we are determined to see this through.', 'Again, I am very proud to be in the role I am at, at Mosaic. It’s a terrific company with again a noble mission. We are confident we are on a very attractive course for our shareholders. So with that, Matthew, I’ll stop and take whatever questions the audience might have.']",management_discussion,MOS_52257
3288,Matthew Korn,"['Thanks, very much Larry and we’ll open it up to questions in the audience. Just let me – I’ll kick it off with just a simple one. As you mentioned, potash shipment growth over the past six, seven years has been somewhat soft relative to that of the other nutrients. In 2012, I think what’s particularly challenging is as you saw the contracting process for some of the Asian importers delayed for few months.', 'Can you talk a little bit more about what you are seeing so far this year that’s making you so optimistic to see a record year and whether this is a simply a reaction to price and a lot of price or is there something more?']",management_discussion,MOS_52257
3289,Larry Stranghoener,"['Yeah, I think that prices have been declining to be sure, because in the potash market we’ve seen a case where supply has gotten a little bit ahead of demand. And the question we asking, potash is when will demand catch up with supply. We think that prices are now at a level where crop nutrients are very affordable. Farmers everywhere in the world are doing very well.', 'They are getting powerful signals to plant as much as they can to get the best yields they can and with crop nutrients, potash in particular at the current prices they are far more willing to buy than they might have been just six or nine months ago. And so as a result, as said, we think we’ll see record demand this year, even in places that have been stubborn in the past few years such as India and China.', 'We still have a long way to go to make sure they get back to their former peak levels, but we are starting to see good movement of product into those two key geographies. And of course, we are continuing to see very strong growth in Brazil, as you known and very strong growth in the Malaysia and Indonesia as well.']",management_discussion,MOS_52257
3290,Unidentified Participant,"['Thanks, I wonder if you could talk about the perception that potash is going to go into the chemical, is going to go into oversupply over the next few years. If you could talk about that? And also, there has been disappointment this year about Indian demand last year and that is because they don’t have any capacity themselves within the country and so that – so they were subsidizing other competitive products?']",management_discussion,MOS_52257
3291,Larry Stranghoener,"['I’ll address both of those questions. In potash, we are seeing new supply coming on-stream, it’s coming on as we speak. It’s coming on in our hands in the hands of other competitors of ours. What you typically see in commodity businesses like this is supply comes in stairs up fashion, whereas demand is more regular and so we are in a period now where I think, we think, supply has gotten a little bit ahead of demand and it’s created a bit of a sloppy pricing environment.', 'It’s why prices have been declining somewhat. That said, with the demand we are seeing now, record demand this year, assuming demand continues to grow at 2.5% to 3% per year, we will soon be in an environment where this capacity is absorbed, operating rates in the industry can increase and that sets the stage for an improved pricing environment going forward.', 'Over time, one of the key questions in this industry is, will there be new Greenfield entrants, a number of the big mining companies have announced intentions to get into this industry. Some of those plans have been scrapped as of late, others presumably are going forward.', 'It will be quite interesting to see over the next year or two what the supply picture by the end of the decade truly does look like. Longer term, by the next decade, we think this industry will need Greenfield expansions and the economics are such that, unless we see potash prices approaching $600 a ton, the economics we don’t think are there for Greenfield expansions.', 'With respect to the India subsidy issue, India has got a large political issue on their hands, because they’ve got a fertilizer subsidy regime which overincentivizes the application of nitrogen. And so, at the expense of phosphate and potash and it’s just as you say, it’s at least a – would say it’s partly they’ve got an indigenous nitrogen production industry and they do not have an indigenous phosphate or potash production industry.', 'This has got to change. Economic signs says this can’t continue if they continue down the path they are on, it will, they will pay a price in terms of yields, and given the critical issue of food security in this country, it can’t last, but we are dealing with a political issue and so it’s very difficult to predict just how when this might be resolved. We just know it has to be resolved.']",management_discussion,MOS_52257

Yes sir, another question in front. Wait for the microphone please.']",management_discussion,MOS_52257

I came to London for the better weather in London than we’ve been having back in Minnesota over the last few months. So it’s been a very late spring planting season. We’ve never been concerned about.', 'Planting always happens. Planting is so efficient in North America. It can all be done in the space of ten days if necessary. As you point out, last week was a week of almost record progress in terms of plantings. This crop will be planted, fertilizer will be applied, we think it’s going to as we projected a good – very good spring application season which followed a very strong fall application season.

3297,Larry Stranghoener,"['You are right. I think that, we think this is a structural change as much as we should warrant the case. This all stems back to the same boom burst cycle we had in 2007, 2008 when a lot of dealers and distributors, our customers got hurt very badly by having products that fell dramatically in price.', 'And they have become highly risk adverse ever since to the point where they are willing to take on how they are getting pricing risk whatsoever. So, it has fallen upon us as producers to take that price risk meaning that we are going to have we think permanently higher inventories and it’s permanently changed our approach to supply chain as well.', 'I think we’ve adjusted as I know we have at Mosaic, we are prepared to deal with going forward. If it ever changes, there is probably pent-up demand just to put the pipeline fill to the tune of 2 million to 4 million tons, but we truly don’t expect that.', 'The one possibility is because of the shakeout among dealers and distributors, we are seeing a consolidation, we are seeing much stronger players, much savior players with better balance sheets. Some of them have come to realize that whenever they wanted to take price risk they lose some opportunity and so, that maybe the one thing that causes it to change a little bit. But by and large we think it’s a structural change.']",management_discussion,MOS_52257
3298,Unidentified Participant,"['I’ll ask another if I can. Mosaic is doing some preliminary work as you mentioned on debottlenecking and maybe even a new ammonia facility than in Louisiana.

Could you maybe discuss a little bit how you are evaluating, where you in evaluation of their project and when we might hear more about it?']",management_discussion,MOS_52257
3299,Larry Stranghoener,"['Yeah, I described in my comments, our ammonia position. We are short 1 million tons of ammonia. We hate the fact that we are paying $600 a ton for that ammonia. So we are well into the process of fund an engineering for a new ammonia plant that would make us self-sufficient.', 'So the equation that we’ll have to solve for is, what do we think the long-term supply demand price of ammonia is, the long-term supply demand price of natural gas is, compared to the capital cost of this project. And we are coming to a final conclusion, ultimately it’s in our interest to have more ammonia capacity which should reduce the price of ammonia.', 'There have been, I think, 29 ammonia projects announced in North America and we are trying to sort out how many of those are real and how many of those are fake. So, we’ll see, we’ll be making a decision by the end of this year and it will be based upon that calculus that I just described. Yes, ma’am.

3301,Larry Stranghoener,"['I think, a couple of things have changed for the worse, in India the subsidy issue that we talked about and so, the amount of potash being applied in India is 2 million tons to 3 million tons lower than it was just a few years ago, even now they are producing more now.', 'So, ultimately, to get back to what we would consider most agronomist would consider to be balanced nutrition ratios, they need to be applying at least 3 million tons more potash. And the ability to get there depends upon the comments I made earlier about changes in their subsidy system.', 'In China, it’s a little bit different story. It’s – I’d say, it’s more a matter of their buying power and their willingness to take a holiday with respect to potash and take the chance of lower yields because, they don’t like, frankly the structure of the potash industry. And so, they are very tough negotiators on price even at the point of perhaps being penny wise and pound foolish backing away from market not taking as many tons as they had in the past.', 'They are too, I think, they are down probably about 2 million tons from their peak level. It’s starting to grow at the end, no. And so, I think with potash prices having come down, affordability being what it is. I think we’ll see a good path forward in China from here on now.']",management_discussion,MOS_52257

In fact, just the opposite, we think as seed technology improves, as yield move from 160 to 300, it’s going to require more nutrients.

I don’t know how this is going to play out, that’s the honest frustrating truth of this and then a bit of it is awkward position of negotiating in public with the other two parties to a transaction and then also in this awkward position of – it won’t be all that of stock price decline before we do a big repurchase and yet no CFO wants to see a stock price decline.', 'So it’s just an awkward period because of the way this deal was structured.

3313,Larry Stranghoener,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining us this morning. As we promised during our last quarterly earnings call we are hosting this call to help you understand the capital management philosophies that will guide Mosaic’s actions in the coming years. As you know, our opportunities to manage our capital become flexible after May 26th of this year, the two year anniversary of the Cargill split-off transaction. After May 26th we will be able to engage the MAC Trusts and Cargill family members owning Mosaic shares and substantive discussions on the timing and structure of one or more transactions designed to transfer their Mosaic shares. In anticipation of this state we have managed our balance sheet in order to provide us great flexibility and we look forward to enhancing our capital structure.', 'Today we will provide insight into our decision making process and priorities by reviewing our capital management philosophy. Our philosophy is founded on the principle of generating attractive shareholder returns overtime and maintaining a solid sustainable financial foundation, while operating with a much more efficient balance sheet. While we do not yet have complete and final elements of our plan, we look forward to more fully deploying our balance sheet for the benefit of our shareholders.', 'First, let’s discuss our balance sheet targets. These targets are driven by our objective of maintaining an investment grade rating and financial flexibility. An investment grade rating is important for allowing access to credit markets, optimizing our cost to capital, facilitating joint venture opportunities, and for meeting regulatory obligations.', 'Let’s begin with our liquidity target. Mosaic will target a liquidity buffer in the area of $2.25 billion comprised of roughly one-third cash and two-thirds credit line. Given our historical financial performance and future prospects, we believe we can increase our current credit line to accomplish this objective. The target is not a minimum but rather a benchmark as to where we would expect to be under this more circumstances. When there are normal calls on our liquidity like when markets are strong and we are building inventory prior to the fertilizer application season or in periods of cyclical weakness our liquidity buffer could drop below this target for short periods of time.', 'Next our targeted leverage ratio or adjusted debt-to-EBITDA is 1.5 times. When rating agencies look at debt they generally adjust it to include pensions and certain other liabilities. Today, Mosaic has approximately $1.5 billion of adjusted debt. Keep in mind that EBITDA used in the calculation represents a cross-cycle estimate so the annual ratio will vary overtime. Over the past five years Mosaic has averaged about $3 billion annually in EBITDA. While our target leverage ratio is 1.5, we believe we could go to 2.0 times adjusted debt-to-EBITDA, while maintaining an investment grade rating. We consider the difference between the target of 1.5 and 2.0 as contingent capital available for strategic opportunities. If we move to this higher level of debt, we would expect to replenish this contingency prior to resuming share repurchases.', 'On this slide you see a breakdown of our estimated surplus cash. These numbers are all approximate of course and at a single point in time. Of our estimated $3.7 billion cash balance at the end of this fiscal year, about $950 million of foreign cash is currently targeted for use in international investments such as our joint venture interest in Ma’aden. We will hold approximately another $750 million as a liquidity buffer, which would leave us with about $2 billion in available surplus cash.', 'Moving to slide 6, we have said, on multiple occasions during the past few years that our balance sheet is not as efficient as we would like it to be. We have surplus cash and debt capacity. Based on existing adjusted debt of about $1.5 billion and $3 billion of EBITDA, the average over the past five years we could issue approximately $3 billion in additional debts, taking us to our targeted leverage ratio of 1.5 times.', 'Of course this number could and likely will change based on expected future EBITDA. We would like to use a sizable portion of this surplus cash in debt capacity for share repurchases where the amount and timing will be influenced by our post May 26th discussions with the parties to the split off agreements. As we indicated on our third quarter call we may also use a portion of the surplus cash in that capacity approximately $600 million to fund an escrow for existing asset retirement obligations in our Phosphates business.', 'Finally another portion could be used for strategic investments. From a timing perspective we would like to achieve these targets as soon as reasonably possible, ideally no later than mid-2014. As noted we view share repurchases as an important tool to accomplish our targeted goals. Therefore timing will be highly dependent on market conditions, the price of our stock, and our ability to reach agreement with the parties to the split off agreements.', 'Longer term, once we have reached a more optimal balance sheet and resolve the backend transactions related to the Cargill split off transaction, our priorities for use of the cash we generate have not changed. For clarity, let me review them.', 'Our first priority is to maintain the targeted balance sheet ratios I discussed and an investment grade rating. Second we intent do sustain our assets and provide for our quarterly dividend. Our third priority is to pursue growth initiatives including capital expenditures to grow the business, and opportunistic strategic investments and finally we expect to return remaining cash to shareholders.', 'We have covered the first priority in detail but I would like to provide perspective on the remaining priorities. Sustaining capital is expected to be around $700 million this fiscal year. We expect this amount to remain flat over the next few years. We anticipate that our current $1 per share dividend will grow as our earnings grow over time. As we discussed in the following slide we intent to use share repurchases as the primary method of returning surplus cash to shareholders. Note that we are not specifying a target payout ratio or dividend yield.', 'This chart reflects our estimated growth in capital expenditures over the next several calendar years. First we are announcing today that the final 2 million tons of our Potash expansion strategy are being deferred. When market conditions warrants and when risk adjustable returns justify them we expect to reinitiate these projects. We believe these projects will continue to be the most cost-effective expansions to come online when market conditions warrant the additional capacity.', 'The capital spending for Potash expansion shown on this chart are previously approved expansions primarily the (inaudible) mine. Second we have committed to grow in Brazil and to invest in further supply chain growers. Third in Phosphates the Ma’aden project is proceeding under the heads of agreement and we are well underway in finalizing our joint venture agreement. Fourth, the potential ammonia project in Faustina is still undergoing forming engineering and design work. While the project is shown on this chart, we won’t make a final go-no-go decision until later this year.', 'Finally, though not shown here, our next two phosphate mines Ona and Desoto are in the permitting stages. We plan to begin construction of these new mines during the latter half of this decade with production feeding our phosphate operations by the end of the decade. This will require roughly $2 billion of capital over a three year span beginning in 2017. Commitments to these projects and future capital expenditures are based on operating cash flow levels and an assessment of risk adjusted returns.', 'For most of our projects if we look at our number of scenarios and assess the probability of meeting or exceeding our risk adjusted return targets before proceeding.', 'Our philosophy on returning capital to shareholders includes both dividends and share purchases, note that we have a good track record of returning capital and we expect to build on this during the next 12 to 24 months.', 'In the near term, we favor using share purchases as a primary way to return capital, improve our balance sheet efficiency and move toward our longer term balance sheet targets. Longer term, we expect share repurchases to include a combination of price-driven opportunistic repurchases given the inherent volatility in our stock and time averaged repurchases.', 'We will continue to favor investing for shareholder value creation over share purchases as long as returns on those investments exceed our risk adjusted return requirements.', 'Next, let me turn to details of the Cargill split off transaction. We have build our current financial capacity in large part in contemplation of this transaction and are well prepared to address opportunities that may arise after May 26, when we can engage in discussions the MAC Trust and Cargill family members who will continue to own Mosaic stock.', 'As you know, the terms of this transaction have restricted our ability to repurchase shares since the initial formation offer in May 2011 and continue to do so. As a brief refresher, there are approximately 129 million class A restricted shares outstanding, half of these shares or about 64 million are held by the MAC Trust while the other half are owned by Cargill family members.', 'Pursuant to the spilt off roles we cannot have substantive discussions with these owners about their plans to transfer Mosaic stock until after May 26 of this year. It is possible that plans may differ between the MAC Trust and Cargill family members. For example, some of the family members may want immediate liquidity and want to sell all of their Mosaic shares while others may want to hold the shares as a long term investment.', 'The terms of the split-off also restrict Mosaic’s ability to engage in open market or direct share repurchases until November of this year. After November, there will be no contractual restriction on Mosaic’s ability to repurchase shares whether directly from a MAC Trust, the Cargill family members or in the open market should we have a desire to do so.', 'When the split-off transaction was completed two years ago, the structure contemplated and orderly distribution of class-A shares to be sold through three annual secondary offerings. The first schedule to occur between May and November of 2013. To that end, the MAC Trust have a right to notify us within 30 days after May 26 of their desire to move forward with the secondary offering and the Cargill family members have the right to piggyback with the MAC Trust on the request. The size of a potential secondary offering is not limited by current track. They could be part of all of the 129 million class A shares and would be sized in accordance with what the market will reasonably bare as determined by Mosaic and our underwriters.', 'If one-third of the 129 million class A shares or 43 million shares are not sold in the secondary offering or otherwise disposed of prior to November in 2013, 2014 and 2015 respectively they will automatically convert to regular common shares that are freely tradable by the MAC Trust and Cargill family members at that time. Said another way, if not otherwise sold MAC Trust and Cargill family members prior to these dates, the lock ups on those shares expire. This complex structure was implemented as a way to provide for an orderly distribution of Class-A shares. This is the base line and its contractual in nature; meaning that it can be modified if the different and the more conducive transaction structures agreed upon by the parties.', 'After May 26th, when we are able to engage and substantive discussions with the parties involved, we will review the original process I just outlined as well as other potential transaction structures which may include share repurchases earlier than November. Our objective is to satisfy the interest of Mosaic and our common shareholders while meeting the liquidity desires of the Class-A holders in a sufficient manner as possible. So, let me summarize the information we have covered today, first and foremost, our priority is to generate attractive shareholder returns overtime. In doing so, we are committed to maintaining an investment grade rating.', 'Given our balance sheet and liquidity targets, we believe we currently have approximately $5 billion of surplus cash and debt capacity. This amount will vary based on our future EBITDA performance and prospects. We expect our recurring dividend per share to grow in line with earnings growth. We expect to fund our ongoing capital expenditures primarily with operating cash flow.', 'We favor repurchases over dividends to deploy our current surplus cash balance and as a primary way to meet our updated liquidity and leverage targets over the next twelve to twenty four months. Longer term, we will continue to favor investing for shareholder value creation or share repurchases as long as returns exceed our risk adjusted requirements.', 'Finally, we have been diligent about building and sustaining our strong financial position and we look forward to deploying capital more efficiently in the near future. With that, we will take your questions. Operator?']",management_discussion,MOS_51709

What our performance would be during the last two years and so forth, and so the way that we look at is that this is a baseline, and of course general rule today is that we cannot engage in direct share repurchases until November of 2013, but if the interest of the Mac Trust and Cargill Family members are such and it would permit the probability of some or a major portion of a shareholder distribution plan during the next six months to include share repurchases, that would be something that would be included in an amendment to our current agreements. So time will tell, hopefully very shortly, after May 26 we'll have a better idea as to what potential alternatives might be out there.

3351,James Prokopanko,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining our third quarter earnings discussion. The quarter played out essentially how we expected it would. The potash we opened with products flowing once again to India and China and those flows facilitated increased demand in North America late in the quarter. At the same time, the phosphate market remained in balance.', 'As you are well aware, our fiscal third quarter, which typically was slowest of the year. So this morning, we will focus more on our outlook than on the quarter. Before we get to that, I will review the numbers quickly. For the quarter, we reported operating earnings of $419 million on net sales $2.2 billion, both up slightly over a year ago.', 'The potash business unit contributed $216 million in operating earnings and the phosphate business unit contributed $197 million. In total, we reported earnings per share of $0.81, or $0.88 per share excluding the notable items, compared with $0.64 a share a year ago. We generated $371 million in operating cash flow during the quarter and we continue to maintain a strong cash position with $3.3 billion of cash on hand.', ""Now, I'll spend some time on our overview. First, agricultural fundamentals remained strong around the globe. This bodes well for the world's growing population and also for Mosaic. Even with the expected bumper crop in Brazil and other parts of South America, food supply is fragile. As a result, farmers preparing for spring in North America, have many incentives to plan every available acre and to ring out maximum yields from every field."", ""Commodity prices have declined modestly as futures markets recognize the potential for a big 2013 crop. The prices remain high relative to historical norms. In part, that's because many analysts do not expect yields to return to the trend level this year and because there were significant pent up demand world-wide for grains and oil seeds. We share that point of view. In fact, while there are a number of potential outcomes for the 2013-2014 crop, the likely place from our advantage point builds back only one-half of the inventory drawdown this year leaving commodity prices at elevated levels."", 'And, I would remind you that agricultural commodity forecasters were signaling similar expectations at this time last year and farmers responded by planting 96 million acres of corn in North America. As we all know, the big anticipated crop withered and prices left to new heights. Farmers nevertheless delivered the second largest global crop in history last year and the world still consume more grains and oil seeds than it produced. So, my message is this, the world needs everything that agricultural land can produce while volatility will always exist in our markets, this simple fact more people need more food will not change.', 'So, our outlook for the long-term remains strongly positive, even as we face challenges. Of course, the challenges are ever changing. Three months ago, we had no potash contract with India. We just completed a protracted contract negotiation with China and lower Mississippi River levels with threatening the supply chain. All those issues have now been resolved.', 'To help you understand the challenges we face today, I will describe in more detail the dynamics affecting the potash and phosphate markets. In potash, the market is on track to reach our forecast for global shipments in 2013. In fact, we believe shipments will reach the upper end of our expected 55 million to $57 million ton range. The contracts with India and China, provided a better-than-expected base load for demand. Established a floor for prices and should reduce inventories to low levels. The expectation of a strong spring planting season further improved short-term sentiment.', ""Our operating rates reflect the improved conditions. Mosaic's potash mines operated 78% of capacity during the quarter, and we expect operating rates to increase in the fourth quarter as we continue to meet the better-than-expected demand from China and India. We expect potash prices to remain in the current range until we see how fundamentals play out later this year. Our 3 million tons of ongoing potash expansions are proceeding as planned. Overall, they remain on budget and on time. That said, we are continuing to evaluate the remaining 2 million tons of expansions and expect to make a decision to proceed or delay sometime this calendar year."", ""The phosphates' market remains balanced. We are seeing outstanding demand in the western hemisphere, and as supply has tightened, we have seen Tampa export prices improve by $50 per ton from their lows. The story is more difficult in Eastern Hemisphere, where Indian subsidy policy continues to hurt soya health and fertilizer sales. We don’t expect the Indian buyers to come back to the market until the end of our fiscal 2013."", 'Longer term, out outlook for the phosphate business is positive as the joint venture we announced last week illustrates. We are thrilled that Ma’aden invited us to participate as an equity partner for their second phosphate project, validating our technical knowledge, industry expertise and positive global reputation. It is important to highlight that this new project has long been incorporated into industry supply expectations.', ""This investment has many benefits for Mosaic. It supports our growth strategy and partially meets the growing demand from our international distribution operations. It is expected to generate attractive returns. It gives us access to very low cost phosphate production. It provides more cost-effective access to India and other Asian markets. It gives us opportunities to participate in future Ma'aden expansions and it further diversifies our sources of products."", ""It's important to note that this project is part of our phosphate growth strategy and does not change our plans for our Florida and Louisiana phosphate business. The rock and fertilizer we produce in the U.S. remain critical to Mosaic and to the world's farmers. Once the Ma'aden operations are in production, which we anticipate to begin in late 2016. We also would be able to allocate more of the domestic production to North America and South America. In turn, we should be able to generate higher netbacks from these operations. Our domestic facilities will also continue to be the source of our innovative higher margin MicroEssentials product."", ""Before I call upon Larry, I would like to highlight some recent external recognition we have received. For the second straight year, we were named to the Ethisphere Institute's list of the world's most ethical companies and we are the only large agricultural company on the list. We are proud of this achievement because it demonstrates that we are living up to our values of excellence, integrity, sustainability and connectivity."", 'Now I will ask Larry to talk through our thoughts on capital allocation and provide updated guidance.

3352,Lawrence Stranghoener,"['Thank you, Jim and good morning. We have been traveling to meet with investors frequently over the past few months and we put one refrain rise above all others. You want to understand our capital allocation policies and just what we intend to do with our balance sheet. So rather than go through our quarterly numbers in detail, I will provide as much insight as I can on capital.', 'We have been working to refine our financial policies to align them with the updated strategic priorities we revealed last fall and to ensure that we effectively operate as a fully independent company following the final completion of the Cargill transaction. The policy work is nearly complete and we are planning to provide more detail before the end of the fiscal year. In the meantime, I can give you some previews.', 'While we will always seek to retain our investment grade ratings and a reasonable liquidity cushion, you should expect a substantially more efficient balance sheet in the future. By more efficient, I mean we would carry less cash and more debt. To get to that more efficient balance sheet, we would like to return excess capital to shareholders through share repurchases which become possible when tax restrictions expire in late May.', 'To remind you, there are 129 million Class A restricted shares in three tranches, each with 43 million shares. These tranches are expected to be sold or convert to common in each of the next three years beginning this summer. It is possible but by no means a given that we could negotiate an accelerated release of all of those shares. Our initial focus will be on the first 43 million shares per the existing agreement.', 'We look forward to initiating discussions regarding those shares this summer.. We have the financial flexibility both available cash and unused debt capacity and importantly, the desire to consider a repurchase of some or all of those shares, as well as other options The repurchase of shares in the open market becomes an option once put off related restrictions fall away in November.', 'It is important for you to understand that we cannot engage in any discussions regarding the restricted shares for another two months, and we may not have a resolution or agreement until later in the summer.', 'Turning to financial flexibility, note that our quarter end cash balance stood at $3.3 billion and we expect strong cash flow generation in our fourth fiscal quarter to further increase our cash available for repurchases. However, there are some existing calls on our cash or debt capacity, and I would like to remind you of a couple of our previous comments and ongoing 10-Q and 10-K disclosures.', ""First, we believe a reasonable liquidity buffer will include approximately $750 million in cash as well as available committed lines of credit. Second, we have also disclosed that a portion of our cash would be taxed if repatriated. Today that cash totals approximately $600 million exposed to a 35% U.S. tax rate with both, the cash and income statement impact. This cash is available without penalty to fund non-U.S. investments such as the Ma'aden joint venture and provide a portion of our liquidity buffer."", 'Finally, in connection with the [enforcement] matter that has been ongoing for several years, we may choose to establish a trust to pre-fund existing phosphate asset retirement obligations, which would result in a restricted cash balance of approximately $600 million. This would be simply funding in an existing liability and would have no P&L impact. Note that we may elect to fund the trust by issuing debt given attractive borrowing rates. This matter has not yet been finalized and likely will not reach a conclusion until the end of this calendar year.', ""All told of course, we have substantial cash and borrowing capacity and we look forward to deploying it. After achieving our targeted balance sheet, our cash flow priorities will not change. Our first priority will continue to be investments for organic growth like our current committed potash expansions, which are expected to produce strong long-term returns for shareholders. Second, as our joint venture with Ma'aden demonstrates, we seek strategic investment opportunities. As always, we will only enter into an acquisitions or joint venture if we believe the transaction meets our return hurdles and fits with our strategy and culture."", 'To summarize, Mosaic is in excellent financial condition and we clearly understand the significant opportunity and importance of returning capital to shareholders. Your patience is much appreciated as we work through our complicated but ultimately constructive process. I want to repeat, do not look for a transaction announcement from us in late May as that is only the kickoff date for discussions with the other parties to any transaction.', 'Now, I will turn to guidance. We expect fourth quarter potash sales volumes to be in the range of 2.3 million to 2.6 million tons, compared with actual volumes of 2.0 million tons in the fourth quarter of last year. If we reach the top end of this range, our potash shipments would set a new quarterly record. We expect average realized potash prices to be in the range of $350 to $380 per ton, which reflects a substantially higher mix of lower priced standard product. The gross margin rate for the potash segment is expected to be in the range of 40% to 45%. Clearly, this would be a step down from prior years as higher operating rates are expected to be offset by lower prices.', ""While we continue to aggressively focus on expense management and maintaining our cost curve positions, year-over-year margins are also being impacted by higher depreciation as we bring our new capital investments online and higher labor costs as we have staffed up for a new capacity. Our operating rate in potash during the fourth quarter is expected to be above 85%. Brine management expenses are expected to be in the range of $245 million to $260 million for the year. And phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.6 million to 2.9 million tons for the final fiscal quarter of the year, about in line with last year's volumes. We expect our realized prices for that to range from $475 to $505 per ton, roughly in line with the prior quarter. We also expect the gross margin rate to be about flat with the third quarter. Mosaic's phosphates operating rate is expected to exceed 85% of capacity during the fourth quarter."", 'Now I will turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.']",management_discussion,MOS_48289

If I start off with a cash balance of $3.3 billion, the buffers that you talked about added up to roughly $2 billion.

3405,James Prokopanko,"[""Hello, Michael. The ammonia expansion you've heard us talk about, I think we are one of the earliest out of the gates on that and it has become a crowded field since then. The point that we are at is that we are continuing our feed or frontend engineering design work. We are going to have that wrapped up over the next, I think, 90 days to be complete. This is a large project. The price range would be for 1 million tons of additional ammonia production, which is a combination of greenfield ammonia plant and debottlenecking expansion of our current approximate 0.5 million tons of production."", ""It's going to range, we think, between $1 billion and $1.2 billion. That's a lot of money. So once we have the final numbers, and that's just our practice, for major expansions like this, we like to have a high confidence in what the final cost is going to be before we make the final call. There has been more to be seen on that. There has been a big gold rush mentality on nitrogen."", ""U.S. imports about 7 million tons to 8 million tons of ammonia a year given the price spread between marginal costs of production, which is Russian gas into Ukrainian plants. That's about equivalent to $8, $9 MMBTU gas prices, so U.S. has a considerable advantage, so 7 million tons or 8 million tons are imported into the U.S., I expect that farmers working we are going to see 7 million to 8 million tons of new capacity come into the U.S."", ""These are long lead time projects. If we made a decision today, we expect it is going to be upwards of four years before we get the first ton of the project out considering all permitting and construction costs, so giving you a long story here to say that it's a long lead time, a lot of things can change, so looking at the final cost over the next few months get a better sense of who is really serious about making these serious $1 dollar-plus investments and we will make the call later in the summer.""]",question_answer,MOS_48289

In terms of our global phosphate shipment forecast, we have not changed that we are still in that 63 to 65 range through the first quarter of the year, basis our current point estimate we are kind of right in the middle that range.', ""I think with the exception of India, it's pretty much the same story. Starting in the Americas, North American phosphate shipments have just been phenomenal, frankly. If you look at the numbers from last fall, they are well above the seven-year average, well above the maximum of the seven-year high/low range. We had good follow through during our third fiscal quarter, and we think the fourth fiscal quarter will be about average, so extraordinarily good shipments in North America."", 'Same story in Brazil. As you know that last year total fertilizer shipments there were 29.5 million tons. We think that will increase to 31 million tons. We expect that Brazil will import more than 4 million tons of phosphate products. A record, seeing good demand in most of the other Asian markets. So, we are on track to hit that 63 million, 65 million range, I believe.', ""But one thing I would like to mention that it kind of relates to Don's earlier question, is that even with a good rebound in global yields this year, an important point is to note that I think there is some pent-up demand. If you looked at the chart in our presentation that showed global grain and oilseed stocks you saw the big drawdown that is occurring in 2012, 2013. That drawdown assumes a very modest increase in grain and oilseed use."", ""In fact, if you look at the projected growth in grain and oilseed use in 2012, 2013, it's 0.6%. That followed the previous four years when grain and oil seed demand grew at 2.2%, 2.3%, 2.3%, 2.6% per year. So, I think even if we get a very, very good supply response, what we are going to see is that, some point of grain prices begin to come down or moderate a bit, there's a potential for an unleashing of this pent-up demand and the fact that crop nutrients remain highly affordable simply underpins our forecast for record P&K shipments this year.""]",question_answer,MOS_48289

3415,James T. Prokopanko,"['Good morning. And we at Mosaic wish you all a healthy and prosperous new year. Thank you for joining our second quarter earnings discussion. I hope you all had an enjoyable and safe holiday season.', ""As we expected, the timing issues in some international markets continued during this quarter, and they masked strong business conditions in other parts of the world, especially in the Western Hemisphere. We have 3 key messages for you today. First, farm economics around the world are extremely compelling. And as a result, we expect record global phosphate and potash shipments in calendar 2013. Second, positive fundamentals should take root this year and overtake cautious sentiment. We expect to see volumes increase, followed by stronger pricing. And third, our exceptionally strong balance sheet gives us important flexibility to take advantage of opportunities. All these factors, combined with the ever-growing global demand for food, give us great confidence in Mosaic's future."", ""First, I'll quickly review the numbers. We reported operating earnings of $560 million on revenue of $2.5 billion for the quarter. Potash business unit contributed $316 million in operating earnings, and the Phosphates business generated $245 million in operating earnings. In total, we reported earnings per share of $1.47, which includes the tax items we reported in November. Assuming a normalized tax rate of 23.3%, our earnings per share were $0.99. Finally, we generated $322 million in operating cash flow during the quarter, and we continue to maintain a very strong cash position with $3.4 billion of cash on hand."", ""Beyond the quarter's numbers, agricultural fundamentals are exceptionally strong around the globe, and that bodes well for Mosaic over the long term. Despite the severe drought in the U.S. and weather problems in other parts of the world, this year's global harvest was the second-largest ever. Even so, the world will consume more grains and oilseeds than it harvests this year. Food supply is precarious, and farmers are well aware of this fact. So it should come as no surprise that futures markets are signaling farmers to expand planted area and increase fertilizer applications to boost yield in 2013."", 'In fact, 2013 new crop prices for corn, soybeans and hard red winter wheat have traded at the highest prices ever for the last several months. These record new crop prices support our forecast that U.S. farmers could plant 96 million acres of corn next spring, and the Brazilian farmers could apply a record 31 million tonnes of plant nutrients this year.', ""Just as important, farmers have the cash they need to invest in their businesses. The USDA estimates that U.S. net farm cash income surged to a record high in 2012 and forecast similar levels this year. Put succinctly, farmers do not want to get caught with a short crop in the current macro environment, so they're going to do everything they can to bring maximum yield out of every acre of land."", ""We've seen evidence of this imperative this fall in North America as the nutrient application season brought the highest levels of demand for our products since Mosaic was formed. Farmers are undeterred by the challenging 2012 harvest. They have those high grain and oilseed prices clearly in focus. Though the outlook remains strongly positive, but the short term continues to present some uncertainties for our business. I'd like to enumerate those and give you our perspective on how we expect them to resolve and how we're managing through them. In essence, we view all these issues primarily as timing challenges."", ""Let's start with China, which delayed signing a new contract for Canadian potash until this week. In the meantime, China met some of its farmers' demand with domestic production in rail shipments from Eastern Europe. But a diversity of suppliers is necessary to meet all Chinese potash demand as the newly-signed Canpotex contract makes clear."", ""While we obviously would have liked the higher price, the 1 million tonnes to be shipped to China in the first half of this year indicates very strong demand. And just as important, the contract provides a base load to get the global potash market functioning smoothly again. Customers around the globe waited to learn the price at which the China contract settled before committing to major purchases. Now that the price is known, we expect pent-up demand from other nations to emerge. I'll comment further on the potash market shortly."", 'Second, the story is quite different in India, which continues to struggle with its subsidy policies and currency valuations. Here too we believe the issue was one of timing. India cannot continue to sacrifice food security and its environment by continuing its market-distorting subsidies, which lead to imbalances in crop nutrition. As such, we believe India will return to the potash market this year.', ""Finally, Mississippi River. No doubt you've heard and have seen the media's increasing attention to the river, and that attention is well justified. The water level in St. Louis has dropped below 9 feet for the first time since the Army Corps of Engineers began keeping records. That's 20 feet below normal. If river levels do not rise, we and the rest of the industries that rely on America's most important passage for commerce will face challenges."", 'Based on our estimates, 2/3 of the urea, 1/2 of the Phosphates and 1/4 of the Potash that reach North American farms travel on the Mississippi. So the possibility of a closed or severely-restricted river could mean that farms will not be able to get all the nutrients they need for timely spring application.', 'The river issue could begin impacting our results in the fourth fiscal quarter. Customers could begin buying sooner with the intention of filling their sheds in advance of a major shipping slowdown, and importers would struggle to get their products into the U.S. In response, phosphate prices could rise and benefit producers who have been able to move that product to warehouses in advance of spring. We have been working to do just that.', 'To summarize these challenges, in countries where markets are working freely, agricultural fundamentals and demand for our products are extremely strong. With the China potash contract now resolved, we believe demand will accelerate to reflect the strong agricultural fundamentals.', ""On the next slide, you'll see some evidence to support our optimistic outlook. In 2006, global potash demand declined by 3.3 million tonnes and pricing softened. In the following year, potash demand came back with such force, increasing over 7 million tonnes, that producers struggled to keep up. While our expectations are for a similar rebound in demand, our current forecasts are much more modest than in 2006, 2007."", 'Now I would like to dig a little deeper into our Potash operations. We slowed production toward the end of calendar 2012 to better align with supply-demand dynamics. While our operating rates remain relatively high in the second quarter to meet strong North American demand for granular potash, we extended our holiday shutdowns, and our operating rate for the third quarter will remain below optimal levels.', 'Even as Chinese demand returns, India remains on the sidelines. So we have revisited our forecast for global potash shipments in 2013. We expect producers to ship 55 million to 57 million tonnes, which will be close to the record levels of 2011. Our view is long term, and the horizon looks bright for potash. Even though the new capacity coming online from Mosaic and others could cause a dip in short-term operating rates, we expect average operating rates in our mines to remain high over the coming years.', ""We are continuing with our expansion projects in Saskatchewan because the world's farmers are going to need more potash in the decades ahead. Keep in mind that our 3 million tonnes of approved expansions are all brownfields, which are currently the only kind of expansions that make economic sense with potash prices where they are today. Our remaining 2 million tonnes of proposed projects will be evaluated over the next year."", 'One final note on potash. Demand for our premium products, Pegasus and K-Mag, is exceeding our production capacity, and we are earning premium prices for those products. Farmers are realizing the value these and other innovative Mosaic products provide.', ""By contrast, phosphate market seems to have found a balance after a volatile beginning in December. The market is really a tale of 2 hemispheres. We're experiencing record shipments to the Western Hemisphere and significantly softer conditions in the East. We continue to expect phosphate shipments to reach another record and to extend their steady growth trend. However, we have lowered our estimates for 2012 and our forecast for 2013 due mainly to larger-than-expected declines in India."", 'We continue to make progress towards a potential new ammonia plant. Last month, we were with the governor of Louisiana to announce that the state has granted us significant incentives that will weigh in to our final decision, and we are now focused on front-end engineering and design work at our Faustina, Louisiana location. That work will take about 8 months, and we expect to make a final decision on the full capital commitment this summer.', 'MicroEssentials, our premium micronutrient phosphate fertilizer, continues to deliver excellent performance. Farmers, particularly in North America, are rapidly learning that the minor additional premium product cost leads to significant gains in yield. In fact, MicroEssentials now represents more than 10% of all phosphates applied to North American fields and almost 6% of Brazilian phosphate applications.', 'Overall, even as we enter the seasonally slowest period of our year, we feel good about the performance of our 2 business units in the face of some difficult challenges, and we feel very good about the longer-term prospects for both Potash and Phosphates.', ""Before I leave this discussion of our operations, I'd like to highlight our safety performance. The relentless pursuit of an injury-free workplace is our first priority, as well as an indicator of our operational excellence, and we are making good progress. Through the first half of fiscal 2013, our safety performance continued to track better than last year's record-setting performance with a 13% reduction in our recordable injury rate and a 29% decline in lost-time accidents compared with the first half of 2012."", ""With that, I'll ask Larry to talk through our thoughts on capital allocation and provide our guidance.

So rather than spending your time rehashing our numbers, I'd like to address a couple of topics that I know are on your minds."", 'First, our capital allocation philosophy. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet and that, combined with our expectation of strong future operating cash flows, gives us significant flexibility. We have the cash and the debt capacity necessary to pursue all 3 of our capital management priorities, which are to invest for organic business growth, to act on appropriate strategic investment opportunities and to return capital to shareholders.', ""We are constantly evaluating investment opportunities, and we're maintaining our discipline as we do so. We will only commit capital when it makes strategic and financial sense for Mosaic and our shareholders."", ""Regarding shareholder distributions, you all know that there are outstanding shares that could begin coming to market this summer, and we are committed to managing these lock-up expirations in an orderly fashion. Our financial flexibility gives us the ability to consider a wide range of options, including the possible repurchase of some or all of those shares. We look forward to initiating discussions at the end of May when we're allowed to do so."", ""Now I'll turn to our guidance. Our third fiscal quarter is usually our seasonally slowest with periods of limited transactions and price transparency. We expect third quarter Potash volumes to be in the range of 1.5 million to 1.8 million tonnes, which is substantially higher than last year's third quarter."", 'We expect average Potash pricing to be in the range of $370 to $400 per tonne, which is down for 3 primary reasons: generally lower market prices; our seasonal shift to greater shipments of standard potash, which is more prevalent outside North America; and our increasing Canpotex share, which means even more of our product is expected to be delivered to international markets.', ""Potash operating rates are expected to remain suboptimal, including the extended holiday shutdowns we've already taken. Lower operating rates and expected lower prices will continue to pressure the Potash gross margin rate in the third quarter."", 'In Phosphates, fiscal third quarter sales volumes are expected to be in the range of 2.5 million to 2.8 million tonnes. The balanced current market conditions are likely to continue, and so we expect prices to be in the range of $485 to $515 per tonne.', 'Operating rates and our gross margin rate should be essentially flat with those in the second quarter. Finally, our cost for brine management at Esterhazy were down slightly during the second quarter, but our run rate remains above our previous guidance. We now expect our full year brine management cost to be in the range of $245 million to $275 million.', ""One final note. In case you missed our news release a couple of weeks ago, we are going to transition from our current fiscal year to calendar year reporting. We will complete fiscal 2013 in May, and then we'll enter a 7-month stub period through December 31. The first full calendar reporting year will be 2014. In September of this year, we plan to provide you with new historical financials for calendar quarters back to January 1, 2012. We are making this change to better align our business seasonality with our reporting and to align our reporting with that of our peers."", ""Now I'll turn the call back to Jim for his concluding comments.""]",management_discussion,MOS_44208
3417,James T. Prokopanko,"['Thank you, Larry. Global agriculture experienced quite a rollercoaster ride in 2012. Spring planting in North America created expectations of a record crop and low grain and oilseed prices. Then our planet dried out -- from the U.S. breadbasket to South America and the Black Sea. Those once promising crops wilted and shrunk. Grain and oilseed prices rallied and then rallied further. The economics of farming rallied right along with them, and farmers across the globe are enjoying nearly unprecedented prosperity.', ""But the same cannot be said of the world's food security. I know you've heard me talk about food many times before, and I'm sure some of you are quite tired of hearing of it. But I'll keep talking about it. All of us at Mosaic, all committed to our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs. We'll keep talking about it because food is the Mosaic story, and because the global food story is why investors should see great opportunity in Mosaic."", ""Farm land is barely increasing. But even if farm land could increase at the same rate as the world's population, demand for food would still surpass agricultural production. Growing human prosperity brings with it demand for higher-quality foods, most notably proteins, which, in turn, require more grain."", ""So over the next 4 decades, with no appreciable increase in farm land, the world will have 2 billion more mouths to feed, 1/2 of whom will live in Africa, the only continent that is not yet self-sufficient in food production. And more of our planet's 9 billion residents will demand more protein. It's a daunting, literally life and death challenge. With farm prosperity running high, there is hope that enough capital will find its way to agriculture to nurture the innovative thinking necessary to meet mushrooming demand."", ""Whether that investment materializes or not, the fact remains that farmers will have strong incentive to coax maximum yield from their land, and they simply cannot do that without good crop nutrition. That is Mosaic's promise. We're the crop nutrition experts, and we have the global reach to make an important contribution to global food security, which is one of the defining challenges of our time. That, in turn, bodes very well for our shareholders. So I will continue to revisit this topic frequently.

3419,Vincent Andrews,"[""Can I just ask -- Larry, you laid out the capital priorities, and I think sort of the -- what I get when I'm out talking to investors now, is the ones that know your story well I think understand how to sort of divide up your liquidity around those 3 priorities. But maybe for the third person that's newer to the story, if you have $3.5 billion of cash more or less, and I think the number is about $6.5 billion of debt capacity to stay investment grade, which you listed as a priority, how much organic growth in dollars do you already have laid out to spend? If you went ahead with the ammonia plant, we know roughly what that would cost, but when would you spend that -- the bulk of that money? Would it be next year? Would it be 3 years from now? And then on strategic investment, they haven't really done much other than -- you've made some divestments and so forth, but how much is there really out there to do because I think, ultimately, it nets down to what should investors expect you to be capable of doing from a return to shareholders perspective, both as it relates to potential dividend increases and ultimately, how much stock you could buy back both from the charitable trust and the family members who've you've, of course, can't talk to you right now and then ultimately from the open market?""]",question_answer,MOS_44208
3420,Lawrence W. Stranghoener,"[""Vincent, thank you for the question. That's -- there's a lot to respond to there. I'll repeat what we said in our comments. We have a lot of financial flexibility, and we have very deliberately built up this financial flexibility to deal with the expiration of our tax restrictions and the coming lockup expirations. We want to be able to deal with that situation in whatever way makes sense at the time. It's a little bit situational, it's a little bit hypothetical. We don't know what we're going to be dealing with next summer when those lockup expirations expire. We don't know what those shareholders are going to be thinking with respect to what they want to do with their shares. And so it's difficult for us to be as precise as you all would like us to be. Suffice it to say that we expect to be able to continue to fund our organic growth initiatives through operating cash flow and beyond that, we believe we've got extensive capability to pursue strategic alternatives if and when they arise. And as you point out, we have not seen anything yet that we've seen fit to invest in other than the Miski Mayo Mine. So we continue to exercise great discipline and to return cash to shareholders. I would note that when we've had the opportunity to buy back shares, we have done so. You'll recall that when we did that early last year, we said at the time that was the single best investment opportunity we could find. We would continue to view share repurchase in that light comparing it to other investment alternatives when that time comes. So we're asking for continued patience. We don't have full flexibility yet. We understand that come May, come this summer, that investors are going to be looking for more detail about how we intend to deploy our capital. But accept the fact that until we get to May, until we can start engaging with these shareholders whose lockup -- where the lockups will expire, we can't be more definitive than that at this point in time.""]",question_answer,MOS_44208

We do have a lot of dry powder, but we're not going to blow a hole on our foot just because we have that. There aren't -- we are a natural party to be involved in any kind of acquisitions. There's not many that would do anything without talking to Mosaic first. So I don't feel at all that there's -- that we're going to miss anything here. So just stay tuned. We're being disciplined.

And so we expect something to get done in the first quarter for Potash. The one thing that is really concerning to us in India is just this subsidy that is distorting the applications of both Phosphates and Potash. Potash, for instance, in 1996, the Indian government set out a plan to get to balanced P & K applications. And they set targets of 4 units of nitrogen to 1 unit of Potash at that time. And between then and 2009, they drove that value down to -- on Potash where they were at the target of 4:1. With the changes to the subsidy system and the focus on nitrogen, it is now back up to almost 8:1. So 15 years of very good work thrown out the window. And frankly, that's equivalent to almost 3.5 tonnes of -- 3.5 million tonnes of needed extra Potash in India. Phosphates, very similar. They set a target of 2:1 in that same period and, over the next 15 years, got it down from almost 4:1 to 2:1. Today -- and that was again in 2009 -- today, they're back close to 3:1. So 15 years of very positive impact on getting their nutrition programs balanced, have been lost with this subsidy program, and we think it will be -- it needs to be changed.

Some believe that the terms of the contract show a departure by Canpotex of a price over volume strategy with the 1 million tonnes exceeding expectations and the magnitude of the price decline coming in a little larger that many thought. Can you provide some color as to whether you see a need for producers such as yourselves to adapt to a more competitive strategy? And then the second part of that question is back to the MOU. You signed for -- or Canpotex signed 1 million tonnes for 1H '13. Based on the October 2010 MOU, I believe it was signed for about 3.15 million tonnes. We shouldn't be using this 1 million tonnes as a run rate for the second half of the year as well, is that correct? I only see a few hundred thousand tonnes being left to complete that MOU.""]",question_answer,MOS_44208
3429,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Okay. Two questions. You asked about changing competitive landscape and perhaps just about what's happening in the industry structure is what's behind that. Let's put it in context for the kind of year we're in. We've seen this year, Potash sales down about 4 million tonnes. Potash purchases by buyers down 4 million tonnes. I think that drop in the market caused some players to be more aggressive than what I think was necessary, and they were just very aggressive. They didn't want -- they saw sales down and they wanted to maintain share and that's the behavior we saw. With a return to normalized and continuing growing Potash demand, I think that will be a passing thing, steady 55 million to 57 million tonnes I think we're seeing for this -- the coming year. That will cure the pricing, and we do see strengthening pricing going forward as products -- as we now see 1 million tonnes moving, I expect more will be bought in China and India's, I just anticipate, is just around the corner.

Going forward, we would expect that in 2014, that probably rebounds to the 59 million tonne range and then increases by 2.5% to 3% for the next 3 to 4 years. So in 2017, we're projecting demand of -- in the 63 million, 64 million tonne range. And if you compare that to capacity at that time, we're probably in the mid-70s in terms of effective capacity.

This morning I am going to briefly review the progress we made in fiscal 2012 and in the first quarter of fiscal 2013. Along the way, I’ll discuss the factors that have impacted our business. And finally, I’ll share our outlook on Mosaic’s bright future.', 'Last year at this gathering, I talked about the critical issue of global food security and how innovation in agriculture and the crop nutrient sector in particular plays a role, vital role in taking on this challenge. This fact is coming to even sharper focus in recent months as drought, rising food prices and food security concerns dominating the news. Indeed, within the world sustainable widely recognized one of the greatest tests we’ll face in our life time.', 'What’s compelling here isn’t just that Mosaic is in a position to tackle food security challenge, it’s that our 8,000 talented dedicated employees worldwide are actually motivated and personally challenged by our mission to help the world grow the food it needs. Food security issue presents us and our stakeholders with opportunity so we continue performing our work with a laser focus on innovation, sustainability and excellence.', 'Let’s review some of the tremendous strides we made in fiscal 2012. We resolved litigation that limited production at our South Fort Meade phosphate mine in Florida. We now have access to our South Fort Meade resources which should result over phosphate production costs. We settled a dispute over a potash tolling agreement at our Esterhazy, Saskatchewan mine. Beginning in 2013, we will have an additional 1.3 million tonnes of potash peaking capacity to help meet our customers’ need.', 'We made important headway with our $6 billion potash expansion project. We’ve completed the K2 facility expansion at our Esterhazy mines and our Belle Plaine Phase I expansion. Our mill expansion at Colonsay is almost complete and K3 now bodes the tallest structure in Saskatchewan with the completion of our new headframe. We expect expansion process would generate over one million tonnes of new operational capacity in fiscal 2013.', 'We continued to operate with excellence, reducing production costs and increasing operating efficiency. As a result, we’re maintaining our low cost position in global phosphate manufacturing, improving potash recovery rates. We delivered our best safety year ever as we continued our relentless pursuit of an injury-free workplace. We made further advances in our steadfast commitments to sustainability and corporate responsibility. We were named to the S&P 500 Index, reflecting our position as one of the world’s largest company. And we continued to support our communities with target corporate giving, employee donations and volunteer work.', 'Mosaic’s progress in 2012 was bolstered by an increasingly strong financial foundation. We generated net sales of $11.1 billion, compared with $9.9 billion in 2011. Net earnings for the year were $1.9 billion compared with $2.5 billion in the previous year. And the earnings per share were $4.42 compared with $5.62 in 2011. While volatile markets can impact our business for short periods of time, our financials stream provides you resilience and flexibility. In the midst of our major investments to grow for the long-term, we were able to return significant capital to shareholders. The company purchased 21.3 million shares and increased its divided by 150% during fiscal 2012.', 'Mosaic announced additional dividend increase of $0.50 per share making a 400% total change since the beginning of calendar of 2012. Even after these investments in the business and shareholder distribution, our cash positions remains a source of strength with $3.6 billion as of August 31, 2012. Our successes were recognized externally in fiscal 2012. For the first time, Mosaic was included in the Ethisphere Institute’s list of World’s Most Ethical Companies. We’re the only crop nutrition company on that list. Ethisphere honors companies that promote ethical business standards and practices internally. Exceeds legal compliance minimums and shapes future industry standards.', 'In addition, for the third year in a row, Mosaic was named Corporate Responsibility Magazine list of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens. Mosaic was ranked number 28, up from 67 in 2011 in recognition of its conservation and environmental stewardship efforts as well as its financial and governance transparency. On Tuesday, we reported our first quarter results which were impacted by significant external challenges. Let’s just review a few of those numbers.', 'We reported operating earnings of $610 million, a net sales of $2.5 billion for the quarter. Potash business contributed $416 million, and the phosphate unit generated $208 million in operating earnings. In total, we reported earnings per share of $1.01. Again, we anticipate strong demand for our products in the remainder of fiscal 2013 and we feel great about the foundation we’ve built in eight years as a public company.', 'Our outlook for fiscal 2013 is positive. With this year smaller than expected global harvest driving commodity prices up and delivering strong economics for farmers. Ultimately these conditions will also drive demand for crop nutrients in. This is of course positive news for our industry and our stakeholders but it is not good news for global food security. This summer reminds us yet again that food security if very fragile. I’ll sum up with this because I believe the bear is repeating.', 'The world’s population, now just over seven billion people is expected to grow to nine billion people by 2050. Over the same period, globe’s farmland is expected to increase by only one percent, yet it must yield as much food in that time as it has over the last 8,000 years. The world’s farmers simply cannot meet the demand to outbalanced crop nutrition. Will they brings it to unique strength, a global reach, our innovation, our capital, our assets, to help farmers like the important challenge [ph].', 'Together we will make an important contribution to the world while delivering value to shareholder.

3509,Jim Prokopanko,"['Thank you, a good question, first one, easier than the second one. First is how is the growth going to impact Mosaic the year ahead. This was a searing drought, farmers were in drought central as well as Illinois, Indiana were really some places that devastated by the drought. With comes with drought, its higher grain prices, so we see first of all in general the average farm economy is pretty darn good in the U.S. and in Canada.', 'There are farmers that were really punished but overall we haven’t seen the USDA forecast is with strong farm income probably record farm income, also lot of meant it with high grain prices, oilseed prices and insurance payments in any cases. So the farmers do have capacity to invest in growing maximum yields next year. And at these grain prices when you have next year’s corn at $6 and beans around $13 farmers are going to be heavily intended to grow a big crop.', 'The question is how much nutrient is left in this soil and that those drought affected areas where there is limited crop, not much taken off. There was slightly some potash and phosphate left in the soil. Our belief is that farmers should do the soil test, understand what they have but our general assessment is that most of U.S. farm fields went into the year with deficit positions on phosphate and potash even with the reduced uptake, the drought affected areas, we think there is still economics and justification will increase and potash and phosphate sales.', 'Bottom line, we’ve been building areas of the country that are negatively impacted with fertilizer consumption Illinois, Indiana, parts of Iowa, Missouri definitely, but there is other parts of irrigated Nebraska, the Northwest Minnesota, North Dakota just kind of wonderful crops to the most part not everybody. So there is going to be – we expect that next year that it will be about a wash, demand will equal for this coming year what it was last year. Another element of that is going into spring of this year, it’s important to planting season.', 'Dealers emptied their warehouses. They didn’t want to take the risk of having fertilizer that might drop in value and if you recall in April and May, again a point drop 96, 97 million acres will be planting expectations to high yield. We saw grain prices and we’re prepared for corn prices $74 [ph]. Well that never emerged and what happened was the distribution pipeline in the U.S. was emptied.', 'The dealers have to reload, we have to ship. Even a farmer demand is a little less, we expect our sales to be little less than they were in the past. I hope that answered that question. On to the other of managing our areas of stakeholders, our principal stakeholder is our shareholder. We are responsible for investing our capital, generating maximum sustainable returns and then become sustainable with the various stakeholders who don’t want to take prices to a point that feels demand and reduces the sales at the same time we are making materials capital investment this year in between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion, we need a return on that.', 'That will be about two years where we have over $1.5 billion being invested in our potash operations and our phosphate operations. We have to get a return on that. So the marketplace, if you can tell us what the price is going to be when we sell our products, that we have some influence but not a lot of influence that competition. And on the other side, how we deployed our capital, gets a lot of our attention. We are looking to returns that cover our cost to capital plus the risk premium and that risk premium will vary based on the risk factor of the project, the geography, the technology, the length of time to make that investments.', 'So it’s a number of elements coming and say this is the best place to do investor capital and we rank those investment alternatives and look to those that have the highest returns with the least risk and you just try to find that balance. It’s not a very precise start we don’t have an algorithm to say project rank order A, B and C. There is analysis that goes into it and then you’ve got (inaudible) end but we look at it beyond just this season or next year. If you are not aware, you should know that these potash investments we’re making the K3 shaft, we’re not going to get the first ton of oil with that shaft for five year. So here we’re going to invest, that project, it’s going to be approaching over $2 billion and its going to be five years before we start getting a return, so we have to look very long-term on our investment wide.', 'I hope this is not very maybe a very precise answer, but it’s best we can provide you.']",question_answer,MOS_41549

3517,Jim Prokopanko,"['Well that’s one of what’s now totaling about 13 announced nitrogen plant with capacity exceeding 10 million tonnes. That is – we’ll see what gets built. There is a bit of a gold rush mentality now. Tremendous returns, tremendous margins to producing anhydrous ammonia nitrogen products and the reason for that is you have very low natural gas prices relative to the next alternative which is Eastern European gas prices that’s about $8 in MMBTU, gas shale is $3.50 range. And the U.S. imports about half its nitrogen. Seven million tonnes of anhydrous ammonia is imported so that comes from, so that price is set by the highest price Eastern European.', 'Once we build more nitrogen plants in the U.S., once demand for natural gas builds at these prices, it will coal energy plants being converted to gas energy plants all sorts of energy dependent projects going to natural gas. We’re going to see – our belief gas prices are going to rise, that’s going to take five and seven years. You’re going to see many more nitrogen plants being build which is going to push gas prices up, so that one plant, that was the only plant that was going to be build, it had no impact.', 'One million tonnes is based on the seven million tonnes imports. We build 10 million tonnes of natural gas ammonia plants in this country, replaces seven million tonnes of imports. You’re going to see ammonia and nitrogen products, fertilizer products come down appreciably. There was just a huge margins in it. So Mosaic is looking at an opportunity to ourselves build an ammonia plant in the U.S., Southern U.S. to feed our phosphate manufacturing.', 'We consume about 1.5 million tonnes of ammonia a year, 500,000 we produce internally in our Louisiana facility. We buy a million tonnes on the market. So we are one of the announced ended 13 plants that are out there. So you could see that supply is going to catch up with demand and potentially exceed demand so it might feel good the first couple of years but we’re going to be in an oversupply situation I think would be very cheap nitrogen prices going forward.

3525,James T. Prokopanko,"['Good morning. Thank you for joining our first quarter earnings discussion. I am pleased to report that Mosaic delivered another solid quarter despite a wide array of external and logistical challenges.', 'Today, I have three goals. First, to help you understand the various external factors both economic and sentiment related that are impacting our business. Second, to review our results and progress on strategic objectives and finally to convey our confidence in Mosaic’s very bright long-term future. Simply put, we want to be the world’s leading crop nutrition company and we believe we are well on our way to achieving that vision.', 'First a quick review of the numbers. We reported operating earnings of $610 million on revenue of $2.5 billion for the quarter. The potash business contributed $416 million and the phosphates unit generated $208 million in operating earnings.', 'In total, we reported earnings per share of $1.01 which includes $0.02 per share of negative impact from notable items. It’s important to point out that we continue to maintain a very strong cash position with $3.6 billion of cash on hand.', 'I can’t remember another time in my career when so many of the outside influences that impact our business and global food supply were so volatile. Mother Nature has left much of the planet very thirsty, while also battering us with tropical storms, hurricanes and heavy rainfall in Canada.', 'The North American drought pushed grain and oil seed prices to record highs and the situation is compounded by the growing logistical challenge of the receding the Mississippi River. Drought has depleted the corn crop in the U.S. Heartland, the wheat harvest in Russia and rice in India.', 'Global grain and oil seed stocks are dropping quickly and reaching dangerously low levels. Farmers know this well, and they will once again have strong incentive to maximize yields in the coming seasons. It will likely take two years of trend yields to get stocks back to secure the levels.', 'As a result, prices have climbed dramatically, if the fall harvest continues various potential for grain and oil seed prices to go even higher in order to balance demand with supply. Given the current (inaudible) balance in grain and oil seeds prices are going to remain highly sensitive to weather events. Any indication of a potential negative impact of weather on yields in South America is likely to drive prices still higher. In fact, spring corn planting in Brazil is only 7% complete versus 15% at this point last year due to a prolong dry period.', 'As a result of the historically high grain and oil seed prices, crop nutrients are as affordable as they’ve ever been, as the slide makes clear. Remember it was only a few months ago when experts were predicting some $4 dollar corn, even if grain and oil seed prices were to drop significantly, we would expect to continue to deliver strong results.', 'Financial returns on the farm in many parts of the world are at record levels. The USDA predicts U.S. farmers will realize record cash income and gain in 2012, for the third consecutive year or even part by payouts of crop insurance.', 'In India, cash payouts and farmer returns are increasing along with higher on farm prices for nutrients. And in Brazil, economics remained strong and farmers there are expected to plant record acres of beans and corns.', 'We expect the markets to remain temperamental for the near future. So I’ll focus there for a few minutes. We are often asked, why crop nutrient prices have lost the historical correlation to grain and oil seed prices. The short answer is sentiment and risk aversion. Our own Dr. Mike Rahm, recently published in depth commentary on this subject in our Market Mosaic, publication, which you can find on our website that I’ll summarize briefly here.', 'When fertilizer prices spiked in 2008, the commodity markets in general were reaching new heights. Remember that oil hit a $145 a barrel and demand for oil persisted. The macro economic environment today is considerably weaker. Because of that and other external factors including weather and uncertainty of North American application rates, we’re seeing a continued high level of risk aversion from our customers to distributors.', 'They don’t want to get stuck on the wrong side of a potential price decline. So they are keeping the fertilizer bins nearly empty.', 'For potash, shipments are being impacted by the delayed China and India contracts along with more production capacity coming on line. This has led the market to assume there will be readily available supply later in the season, which in turn makes it easy for distributors to differ purchase decisions.', 'It’s important to distinguish between sentiment impacting recent food market trends which continues rapidly and economic fundamentals which will drive long-term performance. A change in sentiment usually starts with a catalyst. Let me describe a few possibilities.', 'In potash, standard grade is plentiful, with granular have different story. Producer inventories of standard grade potash were high because of delayed shipments to India and China. Once these shipments materialize and believe me they will, inventories are likely to drop, thus changing market sentiment.', 'In phosphates, supply uncertainties remain, with low and declining North American producer inventories, some Mosaic production constraints, continued delays with the modern startup and 30% lower exports from China.', 'And finally, uncertainties surrounding farmer demand resulting from the 2012 drought is already beginning to resolve favorably. The impact of accelerating demand maybe exacerbated by logistical issues presented by the low river levels which may lead to issues with timely delivery for raw fertilizer demand in North America.', 'Any of these factors can create customer concerns about availability and price which could change sentiment very quickly, in which case sentiment will catch up with a very favorable fundamentals I described earlier.', 'Now, I’ll move on to the potash market. As you’re well aware, our expansion then the tolling agreement reversion will give us significantly increased capacity. And we are confident that long-term demand for the product will grow. The current dip in demand we believe is essentially a timing issue and we’re beginning to see improving dealer sentiment North America and elsewhere.', 'In fact, I was with our global sales team late last month and I heard a very positive tone from that group, representing all the major agricultural markets. Dealers are going to fill their beans at some point and we will have the product ready for them. And next year, we expect record demand for potash, with global demand reaching 58 million tons to 60 million tons. To meet the long-term demand, we are continuing to execute our potash expansion projects and they remain on budget and on time.', 'As an example, and as you can see in our slides, our Esterhazy K3 head frame is now in place, claiming the title as the tallest structure in Saskatchewan. While we expect demand to pick up, we are also aware of new supply coming on line. Over the next few years, we expect the operating rates across the industry to remain high as new capacity lags increasing demand. At Mosaic, we will continue to meet that demand.', 'The phosphates market in contrast with potash is very tight. We and producers have low inventories of finished product because of high demand, the situation that has been exacerbated by plant turnarounds and production and logistics disruptions.', 'Global supply uncertainty continues to tighten the market. We expect a 6% to 8% increase in global phosphate shipments in calendar 2012, followed by a 3% to 5% increase in 2013 to a record level of 64 million to 66 million tons.', 'Overall, our two business units generated solid performance given the market conditions and various operating challenges during the quarter. It’s clear that our results are benefiting from our diversification with leadership positions in two essential crop nutrients. More important, we continue to make good progress on our strategy and Mosaic is positioned for long term success.', 'With that, I’ll ask Larry Stranghoener to take you through our financial performance and outlook. After that, I’ll conclude with some further thoughts on the market center future. Larry?']",management_discussion,MOS_41529
3526,Lawrence W. Stranghoener,"['Thank you, Jim, and good morning everyone. We delivered solid results despite weak market sentiment and the logistical issues that Jim mentioned. As you can see on my first slide, revenues were down year-over-year. Phosphate revenues were down 30% due to both lower volume and pricing. Potash revenues were up 10% reflecting flat year-over-year average pricing and higher volumes. That said, the year-over-year comparisons mask the divergence we’ve seen between the potash and phosphate markets over the past six months.', 'As Jim said, tight phosphate markets are driving higher pricing and slower potash markets are leaving prices flat to slightly down. Net operating earnings were down in the quarter as a result of lower revenues. Note that our consolidated gross margin rate increased year-over-year from 28% to 30%.', 'Moving to the potash segment, operating earnings were up as a result of higher revenues. Our margin rate was down due to higher brine management expenses, and the impact of planned maintenance shutdowns, partially offset by a $34 million benefit from an unrealized gain on derivatives.', 'During the quarter, the potash operating rate was low at 65%, primarily as a result of extended plant shutdowns to tie and new expansion projects. Given the weakness in international demand, we took the opportunity to take extra days for turnarounds resulting in 119 turnaround days this quarter compared to 76 a year ago. These dynamics lead to our lowest quarterly production levels in over two years.', 'Sales volumes met our expectations, while pricing was higher than our guidance. Though North American producer inventory levels remained higher than average, we have seen declines three months in a row.', 'For Mosaic, there was a notable difference by type and grade of product. Much of our inventory is standard grade and blend grade product is much more limited. Brine management cost was $67 million for the quarter considerably higher than the year ago, but consistent with last quarter. Most of the incremental spent continues to go toward advanced technologies including horizontal drilling.', 'We expect second fiscal quarter cost to be similar to the first. We also expect fiscal 2013 cost to exceed the fiscal 2012 level although we expect the quarterly run rate to decline in the second half of fiscal 2013. While costs have been elevated, I should remind you that our production at Esterhazy has never been effected by brine inflow and Esterhazy remains cost competitive.', 'Before I move on to phosphates, I want to explain the dynamics of our tolling agreement and our Canpotex allocation process. The tolling agreement reversion goes into effect in January and all else being equal that would increase our Canpotex allocation from 37% to 43%.', 'To-date, these tolling tons, approximately 1 million annually have not been included in our tons sold metric. We sell these tons at costs and both the revenue and the cost of good sold income statement lines reflect this.

3551,James T. Prokopanko,"['Well good day. Good day P.J., good to hear from you. Yeah it’s a topical question getting much discussion in the industry in the farm markets. First, the question about residual P&K in the soil, P&K, I think you’re aware unlike nitrogen is residual in the soil for some period after it’s been applied. So when you apply a ton or 100 pounds of these to a field it’s going to be there for a couple of years. But at the same time, when you apply it, it is not all readily available to the plant. So if you apply 100 pounds of phosphate to a field, it’s going to take three to five years for that to be completely available to the farm field. So yes, the droughts in some badly effected drought areas, the P&K take up by the plants might not have been as much they were in a normal year. However, most soils in the U.S. don’t have the necessary levels of P&K in the soil. So farmers have been drawing down on the P&K banks in many parts of the country and they didn’t start with a healthy balance.', 'So we believe that they’ll be in the worst effected areas, Indiana, Illinois, where we saw some pretty dramatic yield reductions. We’re seeing – we would see a bit of a tail or drop-off on the phosphate and potash application. But they didn’t have a surplus to start. So we think that this coming year in some areas we can see a reduced – reduction of P&K. However, offsetting that is we went into the summer season following this past spring with warehouse stocks very much depleted, there is nothing to pull on.', 'So the pipelines after we feel some farmers may use a little less P&K this year, the net result for us is that our sales that should be similar this coming fall season as they were last year. Now farmers, now do testing, they test, it’s a good agronomic practice once every three years. I think it would be good to, smart for farmers to test the soil, see with the P&K is, but with the high-high grain prices, oil seeds, corn, wheat the incentive is strong for farmers to plan to maximum yielding crops and that is going to take strong fertilizer application rates to get there.

So farmers are going to test to see what’s in the soil, but I think we are getting feedback from the dealers now as harvesters getting to the midway point that because of strong commodity prices improved in some areas rains after Hurricane Isaac as well as demand for winter wheat planting. We are seeing growers, our dealers move from what had been planned to be a very conservative fall application season moving back to one that at least at average if not slightly above.']",question_answer,MOS_41529

With these ammonia prices you can well see in the cost of gas, you can see the attraction that ammonia has had to investors and despite some resistance by current producers saying it was not going to happen when you’re making $400 to $500 ton gross margin on ammonia production, you’re going to track new facilities. And so there is been of a bit of gold rush to building nitrogen plants, everybody has to have won and no wonder when you have 350 gas and $700, $800 ammonia that’s which you’re going to get.', 'So we expect that with the rash of announcements that we’ve seen.

3597,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining our earnings discussion. I'm pleased to report that Mosaic concluded a very strong fiscal 2012 on a high note. The key messages I would like you to take away from today's call are these: first, external factors created some challenges for us and the rest of the industry; second, Mosaic made important and significant progress in fiscal 2012; and finally, prospects for our business this year and beyond are very positive."", 'Mosaic is in an excellent position to achieve our vision of being recognized as the best crop nutrition company in the world. Before I begin, I draw your attention to the dividend announcement we made today. We will increase our annual dividend policy by 100% to $1 per share. This significant capital commitment to shareholder distributions comes after a 150% dividend increase just 5 months ago. So in total, we will have raised our dividend 400% this calendar year. This decision reflects our confidence in continuing to generate strong results and cash flow over the long term.', ""In fiscal 2012 alone, we generated a record $2.7 billion in cash from operations. Even with the substantial dividend increase, we have ample financial flexibility to continue to invest in the business, as well as return additional capital to shareholders. Now let's review fiscal 2012 performance."", ""I'll start with a view of the external factors that influenced our results, and then I'll discuss Mosaic's accomplishments. After Larry conducts the financial review, I will conclude with a review of what's ahead in Mosaic's bright future."", 'In fiscal 2012, global crop nutrient markets were impacted by ongoing turmoil in India and by risk-averse behavior elsewhere. Customers around the globe decreased their inventories to avoid exposure to price uncertainty created by macroeconomic developments, including the European debt crisis, as well as unpredictable potential events in agricultural commodity and crop nutrient markets. Still, we finished the year with a fast and furious spring application season in North America and a strong start to what we forecast will be record shipments in Brazil this year.', 'During the fourth quarter, the global potash and phosphate markets diverged as a result of different supply and demand dynamics impacting each nutrient. In the case of phosphate, the global market tightened and U.S. producer inventories dropped due to record and, in some cases, compressed demand in major consuming countries with the exception of India. We project that the global phosphate market will remain tight given the prospects of record shipments in 2013 and continued nagging supply uncertainties.', 'In the case of potash, the global market is stable. World shipments are projected to decline this year as a result of a drop in demand in a few countries, particularly India, as well as a drawdown of large inventories in several of the major potash-consuming countries. As a consequence, producers filled warehouses and then throttled back production earlier this year. We estimate that distributors in several key countries de-stocked channel inventories during the first half of 2012 and are now either back in or on the brink of returning to the market. The best evidence of this is that Canpotex exported just over 1.4 million tonnes in the first quarter of 2012 and almost 3.1 million tonnes in the second quarter.', 'North American statistics indicate that the domestic pipeline also is at low levels today and that dealers will need to restock for an expected strong fall application season. We project that the combination of this uptick in shipments coupled with normal summer maintenance will result in a significant drop in North American producer inventories and bring the market into better balance going into what we project will be a blockbuster 2013.', ""Against those market factors, I feel great about our strategic progress and the strength we can exert as the world's largest producer of phosphates and potash. Simply put, I believe we have the most powerful combination of assets, talent, innovation and global reach in the crop nutrition industry."", 'In fiscal 2012, we marshaled these strengths to sell about 19 million tonnes of crop nutrients to customers in approximately 40 countries. For the fiscal year, we posted record revenues and nearly $2 billion in earnings, capped off by increasing momentum in a strong fourth quarter. We achieved a return on invested capital of 15%, and we distributed a record $1.3 billion to shareholders or over 65% of net earnings.', 'We executed well on many fronts during the year, and I would like to go through some highlights. Our program to improve operating excellence in our Phosphate business is now delivering annualized avoided costs and cash savings of over $200 million. We are committed to maintaining and improving our low-cost operating position. In fact, we have a 5-year plan that targets an additional $200 million in annual savings.', ""We generated new records for phosphate rock production at our Four Corners and Wingate mines. Our cost per tonne at Four Corners continued to decline, and it is actually lower now than it was 5 years ago. We improved our leadership position in North America, particularly in phosphates. Our program to increase potash operating efficiency achieved annualized savings of $80 million, and we're continuing to identify ways to offset inflationary pressures in Saskatchewan. We invested more than $800 million on potash expansions during the year, and these projects remain on schedule and on budget."", ""In fiscal 2013, we will begin a 2- to 3-year ramp-up of over 1 million tonnes of new potash expansion capacity, and I'm especially proud to report that we had our best year ever of safety performance. We recorded 32.2 million man-hours in the year, an all-time high, and we managed to reduce the number of days lost to injury by 54%. While a single injury is one injury too many, we're making great strides. In fact, in the fourth quarter, Mosaic employees worked 8.3 million hours, and we had just a single lost time injury."", ""Mosaic expanded its innovation advantage in fiscal 2012, and we set a new record of sales of MicroEssentials. We have begun to produce and ship that product from our Faustina, Louisiana plant, as well as from Florida. At present, we have the capacity to manufacture 2.3 million tonnes of MicroEssentials per year. It's important to note that our innovations extend beyond products. Our cogeneration of electricity continues to reap important environmental and financial benefits and so do our innovative water reclamation and reuse programs."", 'Fiscal 2012 also saw the resolution of some lingering uncertainties. Our South Fort Meade mine is ramping up production now that we have resolved litigation regarding the mine, and we expect it to be able to operate at full capacity soon. We have the capacity to produce 5.5 million tonnes of phosphate rock annually at South Fort Meade, which is one of the most efficient mines in the U.S. In May alone, we produced over 280,000 tonnes of rock at South Fort Meade.', 'We also reached resolution of the dispute over a tolling agreement related to our Esterhazy potash mine. In January 2013, we will essentially have an additional 1.3 million tonnes of potash production peaking capacity at no capital cost to Mosaic. And we completed the initial formation offerings for the Cargill split-off, placing or repurchasing 157 million shares of stock. By the end of fiscal 2013, many of the deal-related tax restrictions will end, which will give us increased flexibility to return capital to shareholders.', 'This year, we took several steps to improving our capital efficiency. We restructured our debt and reduced our average interest rate from 7.3% to 4.9% while increasing our average debt maturity to 15.7 years. We purchased 21.3 million shares for $1.2 billion, and as already noted, we will have increased our dividend by 400% in the past 6 months. All these accomplishments led to strong results and positions Mosaic well for the future, especially considering the external challenges.', ""Now I'll turn it over to Larry to review our financial results, and then I'll come back to give you my thoughts on fiscal 2013. Larry?""]",management_discussion,MOS_39141
3598,Lawrence W. Stranghoener,"['Thanks, Jim. Our solid results this quarter reflect the busy spring application season in North America and strong demand in South and Central America.', 'For the quarter, consolidated revenues were down slightly year-over-year at $2.8 billion, with the decline primarily driven by lower phosphate pricing and lower potash volumes. As Jim indicated, we saw a divergence in potash and phosphate markets in the quarter. Phosphate demand and pricing strengthened, while potash remained stable. And while year-over-year results were down, we saw significant improvement versus our third quarter and finished the year on a strong note.', 'We generated $1.2 billion in operating cash flow in the quarter and a record $2.7 billion for the fiscal year. As a result, we now have $3.8 billion in cash, and I should note that the vast majority of that cash, over $3 billion, is currently available to us. It is not restricted.', ""Earnings per share in the quarter were $1.19. That number includes several items that negatively impacted EPS by $0.06. The foreign currency transaction gain of $0.02 per share reflects a gain related to movements in the Canadian dollar, offset by a loss related to the Brazilian real. The vast majority of the impact to this income statement line is noncash and noneconomic, though we also report the mark-to-market impact of hedging our future potash expansion spending. I'll address the other items in my segment commentary."", ""In Potash, average pricing remained flat and slightly above our guidance range, primarily because of the mix of domestic and international volumes and the extended spring application season in North America. Volumes were at the upper end of our guidance range if we exclude the approximate 100,000-tonne impact of the Canadian rail strike. For the North American potash industry, producer inventory levels remained roughly flat during quarter and are higher than historical averages. It's important to remember that some inventory building is required to manage through normal summer shutdowns for maintenance. At Mosaic, we will also be doing some major expansion tie-ins, which will extend our downtime."", 'Additionally, there is a notable difference in inventory levels by type and grade of the product. For Mosaic, much of our inventory is currently standard grade, and blend grade inventory is much more limited. The Potash gross margin was down year-over-year as a result of a $19 million swing in mark-to-market charges included in cost of goods sold, as well as lower operating rates and higher brine management costs. These higher operating costs were partially offset by lower resource taxes. Our previously announced curtailments resulted in an operating rate of 85%, down from 95% a year ago.', 'Brine management costs were $63 million in the quarter, with most of the incremental spending going toward horizontal drilling technology as we managed higher average inflows in the second half of fiscal 2012. For fiscal year 2013, we expect brine management costs to remain roughly flat with 2012, assuming similar inflow rates. In addition, we are investing approximately $100 million of capital for new brine disposal capabilities.', ""Because of current disposal constraints, we've increased the amount of brine stored underground until the new brine injection site is operational later this year. That said, we have substantial underground storage capacity remaining, and most importantly, we do not expect any of our brine management activities to impact mine operations. Resource tax declines were due in part to a change in our estimated completion date of sustaining capital investments."", 'Moving on to the Phosphates business. For the quarter, average prices moved lower year-over-year but steadily increased during the quarter. Volumes were quite strong, driven by high demand in both North and South America. In fact, shipments to Central and South America offset the lack of shipments to India. In addition, we have seen significant interest in summer fill programs and have contracts in place for a substantial portion of the product we can deliver in the first quarter.', 'Phosphates gross margins improved sequentially and exceeded our guidance range due to stronger sales of MicroEssentials and higher prices, which were driven by higher-than-expected demand. Operating earnings in the quarter reflect $21 million of additional asset retirement expense related to the closure of inactive facilities in Florida. Over time, a portion of this amount reflecting accelerated closure will lower future risks and costs.', 'Raw material costs declined sequentially as expected. However, we are seeing increased pricing pressure on ammonia as supply has tightened. In the first quarter, we expect these higher raw material costs to impact our cost of goods sold. In addition, we expect a seasonal shift in our sales mix to more blends, which have a lower gross margin rate. All else equal, we expect that the first quarter Phosphates gross margin rate to be essentially flat with the fourth quarter with higher prices offsetting these cost increases.', ""Before I turn it back to Jim, I'll provide some additional guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. We expect Potash volumes to be in the range of 1.8 million to 2.2 million tonnes and prices in the range of $415 to $440 per tonne. The sequential decline in price reflects both summer fill discount pricing and a shift to more international business. We expect operating rates to reflect the planned summer turnarounds but to remain above 70%."", 'In Phosphates, sales volumes are expected to range from 2.5 million to 2.8 million tonnes. Tight markets are likely to continue, increasing our expected average price to a range of $510 to $535 per tonne. Operating rates will include scheduled turnarounds but are expected to remain above the 75%.', 'Our new annual guidance for fiscal 2013 includes $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion in capital expenditures, $320 million to $380 million in Canadian resource taxes and royalties, $420 million to $445 million in SG&A expenses and an effective tax rate remaining in the upper 20s. I would also like to reiterate our capital management approach for fiscal 2013. First, note that we maintain a minimum liquidity target of $1.5 billion, including unused lines of credit. Today, that would imply almost $3 billion in excess cash on our balance sheet. We are also committed to maintaining our investment grade rating. Even so, we have substantial unused debt capacity and flexibility.', 'Second, with respect to uses of capital, our top priority is to invest in the business. We expect to fund these investments from operating cash flow. In fiscal 2013, we expect to invest $500 million to $700 million in potash expansions. We are also considering building new ammonia capacity, which would bring our ammonia production capacity to approximately 1.5 million tonnes and require approximately $1 billion in capital investment, a portion of which would fall into fiscal 2013. Our second priority is strategic investments like new rock mines or acquisitions or joint ventures. In the current environment, we see limited opportunity for significant strategic investments.', 'The third element of our capital management approach is returns to shareholders. The primary driver behind our current excess capital position is the Cargill split-off. At the end of our current fiscal year, additional restricted shares issued as part of the split-off will become available for distribution. At the same time, deal-related tax restrictions will end, including restrictions on share repurchases.', 'For our shareholders, we believe it makes sense to maintain the flexibility to take advantage of these events. In fiscal 2012, we repurchased 21.3 million shares, all that we could under our restrictions, and increased the dividend 150%. And today, we announced another significant dividend increase. You can be assured that we recognize the importance of distributions to shareholders in meeting our total shareholder return objectives.', ""Now I'll send it back to Jim for his concluding comments.""]",management_discussion,MOS_39141
3599,James T. Prokopanko,"['Thank you, Larry. At Mosaic, we achieved many successes in fiscal 2012, and we have created an exceptionally strong operating foundation for the future. Mosaic has the capabilities necessary to be the best crop nutrition company in the world and to build momentum in 2013.', ""I'd like to provide an overview of our outlook for the markets and our strategic focus for the new fiscal year. The recent surge in agricultural commodity prices, driven by the ongoing severe drought in the U.S. corn belt, reminds us global food security is tenuous. This year, which started with an early North American spring, the largest U.S. corn acreage since 1937 and the promise of a record-smashing crop demonstrates how quickly agricultural commodity markets can swing and how little margin for error exists in the global food system."", 'The summer rally in grain and oilseed prices provides a strong tailwind for crop nutrient demand prospects in 2013 and beyond. In particular, we project that global phosphate shipments will increase from just less than 60 million tonnes in 2011 to approximately 63 million tonnes this year and then climb to 64 million to 66 million tonnes in 2013.', ""In the case of potash, due to the weak start to this year, we project global MOP shipments will decline from about 56 million tonnes in 2011 to approximately 53 million tonnes this year and then jump to 58 million to 60 million tonnes in 2013. Several analysts have expressed concern that the severe drought this year will negatively impact U.S. phosphate and potash use next year because these 2 nutrients carry over in the soil if not taken up by plants. We don't believe this impact will be significant. Based upon a study of similar years and with ongoing high U.S. farm income, good crop insurance programs and growing evidence of P & K deficiencies in key farm states, global grain and oilseed inventories will decline for the third year in a row in our fiscal 2013 as a result of yet another year of below-trend yields."", 'This situation is not sustainable. Yields must increase at trend rates in order for grain and oilseed supplies to keep pace with steady and predictable increases in global demand. And that, in turn, will require growers to keep their foot on the accelerator, to leverage new technologies and best agronomic practices and to ensure consistent and appropriate crop nutrient applications. We expect these factors will drive strong potash and phosphate demand. The demand for grains and oilseeds will only increase, and crop nutrients will remain a critical component of resolving the global food security issue.', 'Moving on to our priorities for the new year. In Phosphates, we will maintain our focus on continuing to operate with lower costs than our competitors, and we will continue to grow our innovative premium products. As Larry noted, we are making progress on the feasibility study for a new ammonia plant, which would further enhance our competitive cost position. Together, these 2 strategic pillars differentiate us from commodity providers while driving higher margins and cash flow.', ""Markets have improved over the past 2 months, driving both volumes and prices above our guidance. While much uncertainty remains for the second half of the calendar year, current market conditions bode well for our fiscal 2013 financial performance. And the longer-term outlook remains compelling. We expect demand for phosphates to continue to grow all around the world while significant investment will be required for supply to keep up with demand. In Potash, fiscal 2013 is an important year for our expansion projects, and we're driving them towards on-time and on-budget completion."", 'While demand will always ebb and flow, the trend for the decade ahead is unquestionably positive. The world needs more potash to feed its ever-growing population, and we will have the production capacity to meet the increasing demand. We will begin ramping up over 1 million tonnes of new potash capacity during the year, and we will control 1.3 million additional tonnes from the tolling agreement by next January. Our committed expansion spending will decrease in fiscal 2013, even as we begin including the second phase of our Belle Plaine expansion.', ""Belle Plaine is the world's largest solution mine, and with the fundamental shift in the natural gas markets holding prices at low levels, it is one of the most cost-efficient mines in Saskatchewan. With the planned cost-effective brownfield expansion, we believe it will be one of the world's lowest cost potash mines."", 'To conclude, we continue to see short-term external risks, including volatile markets in Europe, potentially slower growth in India and China, volatility in U.S. grain prices and ongoing foreign currency exchange risk. That said, none of the economic risks impact the demand for food, which will continue to grow day over day and year-over-year. And Mosaic will have an ever-increasing role to play as we help the world grow the food it needs.', ""The facts bear repeating. The world's population grows by 75 million people every year, an addition that exceeds the current population of Great Britain, and arable land is not increasing. The demand is multiplied by improving human prosperity around the world. As incomes rise, so too does demand for protein, and protein requires significantly more agricultural production."", ""I saw an interesting fact recently. The Washington Post reported that the world must produce the same amount of food in the next 40 years as it has in the past 8,000 years. So there is simply no choice. Farmers must increase their yields, and Mosaic will be here to support them. Mosaic has the assets, the global reach, the innovation, the proven execution capability and the capital strength to outperform its competitors in a highly compelling industry. We've built a powerful engine and a talented team of engaged employees. We are prepared to accelerate."", ""Now we'll take your questions.""]",management_discussion,MOS_39141

In the case of the U.S., I think there's an interesting situation in that even with flat or even slightly lower potash consumption, we think shipments will increase from the drop-off that occurred last year in North America. The 2010, 2011 shipments were at a record 11.1 million short tonnes. Those dropped to about 8.3 million tonnes as de-stocking of the pipeline took place.

3613,Richard N. McLellan,"[""Yes, Don, I think your question is did we have to expand it this year, and the answer for phosphates is most definitely not. Potash, we’ve continued to expand the programs what we have -- that we have and the amount of product that we're going to have available into North America. But that's strictly a function of how the potash market has operated. The -- what we found on the phosphate market is people are -- phosphate and potash in North America, customers are willing to layer in percentages of the volumes that they need for fall. So this cautious conservative buying behavior that Jim talked about continues, although we don't find that we've had to do anything different in the marketplace. The second part of your question had to do with the differences between domestic netbacks and export netbacks. One of the things that you have to break away is the difference between blend-grade product and standard product. And as we move over time, those spreads are going to continue to -- the export and domestic prices are going to continue to get closer together. But one thing that impacts the netbacks probably the most is standard product going into contract markets, so it leaves that spread wide. And when you take a look at the North American market, it's a blend-grade market, and so I think one of the ways to look at it is blend-grade around the world continues to trade at a premium to standard.""]",question_answer,MOS_39141

We expect to be at full production at South Fort Meade in the first fiscal quarter of 2013. Our investments to expand capacity at both Potash and MicroEssentials remain on track and on budget. Our operational excellence programs continue to bear fruit, with newly identified initiatives in Potash having already exceeded $60 million in potential benefits. And in Phosphates, we have had record year-to-date production at our Four Corners mine, and our Wingate mine performed at record levels in January. As well, we continue to take steps to realize the value of our exceptionally strong balance sheet by increasing our regular annual dividend by 150% to $0.50 per share."", ""In Phosphates, we saw an acceleration of sales in both our future price deferred programs and other sales programs after phosphate pricing in North America bottomed in January.

That said, we have product positioned in the marketplace ready for growers to apply in anticipation of what we expect to be a strong North America spring season. I'll provide more thoughts on this topic shortly."", ""We've seen resolution of some major uncertainties that have been impacting market sentiment. The changes to the Indian crop nutrient subsidy are now known, although there remains some uncertainty as to the ultimate demand impact.

The price is unchanged from the previous contract. This contract resolves another uncertainty with respect to the near-term potash global supply and demand outlook. Finally, we saw ammonia spot prices decline dramatically this quarter. These events demonstrate that the near-term challenges are diminishing, while both the near- and long-term outlook remains positive.

The December 2012 corn price is around $5.40 per bushel, which is higher than similar contracts in 3 of the past 4 years at this point in the season. Soybean prices have also rebounded, up about $1 per bushel since January, as the 2 grains compete for planted acreage.', ""We're estimating another year of high farm income in North America, the second highest on record, and strong farm economics around the world. This is truly a global market, with non-U.S. events capable of driving grain and oilseed pricing even higher.

We have now largely put these issues behind us and continue taking actions to reduce costs, improve our operating performance and position this business for long-term success.', 'As shown on this bridge chart, year-over-year raw material costs lowered operating earnings by approximately $225 million, more than offsetting the price and volume-driven increases. Of the $225 million, $70 million was due to higher ammonia costs, $60 million to higher sulfur costs and $35 million to higher rock costs. The remaining increase in costs was primarily from components of our international blends that we purchase from third parties. These costs are passed through in higher end product prices, with little impact to margins in the segment.', 'The next few slides will provide more detail on raw material cost trends, starting with ammonia. This historical look shows both the average spot price for ammonia, as well as the price reflected in our cost of goods sold. It demonstrates the lag effect between purchases and realization.', 'The average price of ammonia in our cost of goods sold in the third quarter was $589 per tonne. This higher cost includes the impact of purchases made in late calendar 2011 and the fact that we obtained only a partial benefit from our Faustina ammonia plants.', 'Ammonia market prices fell significantly in the third quarter, and this will benefit our fourth quarter cost of goods sold. In addition, we expect the full benefit from ammonia manufactured at Faustina.', 'Turning to sulfur. We expect a modest decline in fourth quarter realized costs. Our average purchase price in the third quarter was $211 per long ton, and the most recent contract price was $172 per tonne. These lower contract prices will be flowing through cost of goods sold later in the fourth quarter.', 'Cost reflected in our P&L include $10 to $15 per tonne in transformation, storage and transportation costs. For rock, our average price per tonne was roughly flat with the second fiscal quarter. We expect rock costs to remain flat in the fourth fiscal quarter before declining in fiscal 2013 due to the ramp-up of South Fort Meade. For fiscal 2013, we expect our third-party rock purchases to range from 400,000 to 500,000 tonnes, less than 50% of our fiscal 2012 purchases.', ""Before I turn it back to Jim for his concluding comments, I want to spell out some revisions to our annual guidance. For capital expenditures, we've narrowed the range, lowering the top end of the guidance from $1.9 billion to $1.7 billion. We have not revised either our SG&A guidance or our effective tax rate guidance for fiscal 2012. We have lowered our estimate for Canadian resource taxes and royalties from a range of $420 million to $470 million to a range of $310 million to $360 million. Recall that this is estimated for the calendar year and then reflected in our fiscal year guidance. The decline in our estimated Canadian resource taxes for fiscal 2012 primarily reflects the lower sales volumes we've had so far this calendar year, as well as our expectation that North American dealers will target minimal inventory levels at the end of the season."", 'In addition, brine management costs at our Esterhazy mine ran ahead of our guidance in the quarter. While inflows remain well within historical ranges, results for the quarter include higher costs associated with the introduction of advanced technologies, including horizontal drilling techniques.', 'We plan to continue to enhance our understanding, management and mitigation of recent inflow patterns and disposal of brine removed from the mine. As a result, planned brine management costs will remain high but decline to between $45 million and $55 million for the fourth fiscal quarter.', 'Back to you, Jim.']",management_discussion,MOS_37286

And I think Rick or Larry will be looking at some data to reference that. The purchased rock, we've always and for a long period of time have augmented our mined rock with purchases from suppliers, most typically OCP. We intend to continue to buy from OCP, and as long as they continue to sell to us, we have a great relationship with them. They're a good supplier, and we're a good customer. Investing in the Miski Mayo Mine has allowed us to reduce the need for external rock purchases. And the South Fort Meade situation, the last 1.5 years as we waited for the permitting, we've had to buy more than we typically would buy either from Miski Mayo or OCP. So going forward, I think we intend to have a balanced source of supply, buying product from OCP, sourcing from Miski Mayo. We don't give guidance about on that, but the range you can expect is anywhere from 0.5 million tonnes of purchased rock to 2 million tonnes of purchased rock. What we like about the OCP rock is that it is a high-quality ore, high-quality rock. It serves in our blending purposes, helps with our production operations and having the diversification of supply availability. If there's other interruptions at Miski Mayo, serves us well. So I'd say in the range of 0.5 million to 1 million tonnes now that South Fort Meade's fully operational. The question about inventories, it served us well, having a large inventory going into the South Fort Meade permitting process. A good lesson learned there.

On Sunday, we're going to have back up to 80-degree temperatures. Now that's -- farmers have been around long enough to know that, that can change rapidly. So one hesitation by farmers, why they wouldn't be planting more heavily today is, there could still be an early-season frost. And you plant a crop now, you get the moisture, good soil, warm, moist soil conditions. You get a crop up, corn's up, beans are up, and then you get a frost and you lose it and then you have to replant. So that's a very real risk. The other piece is that crop insurance in some of the Midwest states doesn't really kick in, I believe, till early April. And farmers aren't going to plant until they're good and sure there's not going to be an early-season frost nor are they going to plant outside of the crop insurance window. So it'll come.

3724,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Well -- and Mike, like half the analysts on the -- that are listed on this call are on vacation, it appears. So Mike can't be with us today. A lot to be played out in this going forward. You see ranges of 94 million acres plant forecast on corn. I've seen some as high as 97 million. Then you see yield estimates that could be sub-160 to -- I've seen one as high as 167. And our view is that depending on the size of the -- the yields mostly will drive prices. So we think the $5 to $5.50 range, given trend line yields and where our trend on corn is 161 BPA, bushels per acre, and we're forecasting approximately 94 million, 94.5 million acres, and I think we'll be able to sustain prices above $5. Now when you start getting into these higher corn acres, 94 million to 97 million acres, these last anywhere from 5 million to maybe high as 10 million acres are in prime corn growing land. You're starting to bring in land that farmers either hadn't previously had under cultivation or they're going to corn on corn or corn on corn on corn, which poses risks in that. So at a 97 million- or 94 million-acre crop, I think it's going to be, and I think Mike shares this view, a real challenge to beat trend line yields when you're bringing in every acre that you have available that you can plant something in. At the same time, we're not -- we're far from done. We need soybean acres planted as well. So you get pressure to go to this 97 million acres of corn. Soybeans are going to fight back, and you're going to see those bean prices go up and take away from corn. So we're not anticipating short of a bumper crop above trend line yields.

3738,James T. Prokopanko,"['Good morning. Thanks, Laura, and welcome, everyone. Yesterday, we reported another quarter of strong results as highlighted on Slide 3. Our revenues were up 13% from the prior year. Net earnings were up 37%, and earnings per share of $1.40 were up 37% when excluding realized gains from the sale of Fosfertil last year.', 'We had a busy and highly productive second quarter. We improved our capital structure. We purchased 21.3 million shares for $1.2 billion. We issued $750 million of low-cost debt and called $469 million of high-cost debt. In addition, we resolved our tolling dispute at Esterhazy, and we made substantial progress on our strategic priorities.', ""Market fundamentals during the first half of our fiscal year were outstanding. We indicated in our last call that we expected fall industry shipments of North American Phosphate and Potash would equal the outstanding movement set a year ago. I'm pleased to report that shipments from June through November were up almost 1% from year ago. In addition, Brazilian crop nutrient shipments now are expected to reach 28.5 million metric tonnes in 2011, shattering the previous record of 24.6 million tonnes in 2007."", ""We also told you last quarter that we expected a seasonal lull following the large application seasons in both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere and that we expected our customers would delay purchases for the next season, possibly until late in our third fiscal quarter. However, it appears that seasonally slow buying patterns this year have been exacerbated by economic uncertainty, and these requests for price relief and the recent drop in nitrogen values reinforced the distributors' wait-and-see approach. That said, we continue to believe this is a timing issue and global demand will be delayed but not destroyed."", ""Agricultural markets continue to provide attractive opportunities, both near and long term. We remain confident that the fundamentals are far stronger than current sentiment. Markets are sending powerful signals to farmers to produce more, and farm economics remain highly profitable. There is far more confidence among farmers than crop input distributors as evidenced by North American farmers' strong prepayment purchases of crop nutrients in December. I'll conclude my remarks today with more on our current expectations."", ""On Slide 4, you can see our Potash segment highlights. Our potash business continues to generate good results while successfully executing our Potash expansion plans. While sales volumes are flat year-over-year and sequentially, our volumes were down in North America. Our commitments for shipments to Canpotex, combined with low beginning inventories, limited our sales into North America. Our operating rate was 78%, up from 74% last year. We expect to operate at higher rates in the second half in order to meet our customers' needs for the upcoming application season."", 'Average selling price was down slightly from the first quarter, driven by a higher percentage of international shipments and, within international, a higher proportion of standard product shipments under 2 large long-term contracts. By product, standard versus granular and both domestic and international selling prices increased sequentially.', 'Brine inflow expenses were slightly higher in the second quarter due to the introduction of horizontal drilling techniques. We are deploying this new technology in an effort to materially improve our brine management operations. These higher costs are expected to continue through our third fiscal quarter before reverting to recent historical levels. We expect full year brine management cost to reach $170 million to $180 million in fiscal 2012. Costs were also negatively impacted by higher labor costs, in part driven by increasing staff in preparation for the expansions that will be coming online in calendar 2012.', 'Our flagship growth strategy is the expansion of our Saskatchewan Potash operations, and the 4 projects under construction today remain on track and on budget. We invested more than $267 million on these projects during the second quarter.', ""Slide 5 shows the expected increase in our capacity during this decade. At Esterhazy K2, we've completed our aboveground mill expansion ahead of schedule and below budget. Combined with our underground expansion activities, which are nearly complete, capacity is expected to increase by more than 750,000 tonnes a year. In addition, at the beginning of calendar 2013, 1.3 million tonnes of capacity will revert to Mosaic along with the related Canpotex allocation."", ""In 12 months, Mosaic's Esterhazy operation will have 2 million tonnes of incremental Potash peaking capacity to meet our customers' needs. In addition, expansion projects at Colonsay and Belle Plaine are expected to come online by the end of calendar 2012. Belle Plaine, we expect to complete our stage 1 expansion by mid-2012 and are beginning the next phase of our expansion plan. As the operator of the largest potash solution mine in the world, we believe we are best positioned to produce the white, premium potash derived from this type of mining."", 'Because of the nature of our solution mining, our brownfield expansions have a running start on any greenfield solution mine. We can create new cavities faster, drive higher saturation levels for quicker extraction of the minerals and we can leverage existing infrastructure, resulting in significantly lower costs than a greenfield investment.', ""The Phosphate segment, highlighted on Slide 6, operating earnings increased 7% due to higher selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Domestically, we've increased market share, due in part to the success of our premium MicroEssentials product. MicroEssentials now has a 9% share of North American sales. Our MicroEssentials expansion projects will increase capacity to 2.3 million tonnes and are on track for completion before the end of this fiscal year."", ""Sequential improvement in gross margins to 22% reflect higher realized prices and continued mining and operational efficiency efforts, which more than offset higher raw material costs. Continued high operating rates in our mining operations have allowed us to limit phosphate rock purchases. Our Faustina ammonia plant was fully operational by the end of October. We're estimating the net cost of the plant outage to be approximately $10 million in the second fiscal quarter, comprised of $30 million in higher raw material costs, partially offset by a $20 million advance of insurance proceeds."", 'The supply and demand situation for raw materials, as well as their impact on our cost of goods sold, is worth spending more time on. As you can see on Slide 7, raw material costs have been on an upward march for the past 5 quarters. Last fall, we saw continued ammonia price increases, driven by high demand and a confluence of supply limitations. Since peaking in November, ammonia contract prices have declined over 20%. In addition, with our Faustina plant up and running, we expect cost benefits from our own manufacturing of ammonia to begin to accrue in our third fiscal quarter and to be fully reflected in our fourth fiscal quarter.', ""In the case of sulfur, we price our contracts quarterly but have begun to see favorable trends in spot pricing. It's important to remember that our realized prices also include storage, transportation and conversion costs for sulfur. We believe our contract prices will decline in the first calendar quarter of 2012 but remain uncertain as to the magnitude of that drop. Because of the lag between raw material pricing and when those costs run through our P&L, we expect higher phosphate cost per tonne in our third quarter. However, we expect lower raw material costs in our fourth fiscal quarter as we begin to see the benefits of lower input prices, as well as the benefits of our ammonia manufacturing."", 'Slide 8 shows how our rock volumes and costs have changed over the past 5 quarters. The bar chart shows sources of rock used in production. Purchased rock from third parties, excluding Miski Mayo, have increased from 4% of the total a year ago to just shy of 7% today. The majority of rock used in our U.S. operations, more than 90%, comes from our own mines. Our average rock cost, represented by the line on this chart, has risen from $51 per tonne a year ago to $73 last quarter. Three factors have caused this increase: one, the large increase in the market price of rock we purchase from third parties; two, the increase in shipments of Miski Mayo rock, which comes through our cost of goods sold at market price; and three, slightly higher mine rock cost due to low operating rates at South Fort Meade. This chart does not show the offset to purchases from our Miski Mayo joint venture, which we expect to contribute to equity earnings once the mine is fully operational.', ""Now I'd like to provide our perspective on the near-term outlook. Our forecast for record global phosphate and potash shipments in 2012 is underpinned by high prices for a wide variety of agricultural commodities and profitable farm economics worldwide. Slide 9 indicates the strength of farm economics today. Affordability continues to incent farmers to use crop nutrients to improve their yields."", ""In fact, Slide 10 shows the price of new crop corn today is a record for this time of the year, higher than any of the previous 4 years. Dealers in North America report a brisk prepayment season at the end of December. Most report that they have received as many or more dollars as they did during the last year's excellent season. This bodes well for strong spring demand and, more importantly, for strong application rates. Distributors, however, are delaying purchases for the upcoming season. Negative sentiment overhangs phosphate and potash markets due to several factors ranging from political and economic uncertainties to the recent and rapid declines in nitrogen prices. However, fundamentals for our products remain strong, much stronger than current sentiment. So while there continues to be uncertainties surrounding the timing of these sales for the next season, we firmly expect the tonnes will move."", 'Our confidence is reflected in our forecast for North American spring shipments shown on Slide 11. For both Phosphate and Potash, we are expecting North American shipments to exceed the 5-year averages and be nearer the high end of the 5-year ranges. The seasonal lull, combined with our expectation for a strong application season later this year, leads us to expect that our third fiscal quarter will be relatively weak, but much of this volume will be shifted into our fourth fiscal quarter.', ""Our third quarter guidance, shown on Slide 12, reflects a seasonal lull both in terms of volumes and pricing. For Potash, we're expecting volumes of 1.2 million to 1.5 million tonnes and an average MOP selling price of $430 to $460 per tonne. For Phosphate, we're expecting sales volume of 2.2 million to 2.6 million tonnes at an average DAP selling price of $530 to $560 per tonne."", 'Last week, we announced a 25,0000-tonne curtailment of our near-term planned phosphate production. As dealers and distributors focus on the macroeconomic uncertainty and delay purchases for the North American spring season, near-term supply of phosphate barges on the Mississippi River exceeded near-term demand. The spot prices in this market did not reflect our outlook for the business, nor do we think they were sustainable. In fact, in the past week, barge prices have rebounded by $40 to $50 per short tonne. With this production curtailment, our third quarter operating rate for phosphate production is expected to range from 70% to 80%. We expect our operating rate for Potash will be above 80% as we align our production to meet demand requirements.', 'Our annual guidance ranges for capital expenditures, taxes and SG&A have not changed. Post the seasonal low reflected in this guidance, we continue to expect strong farm demand in the first half of calendar 2012 and are forecasting record global shipments for both potash and phosphate in calendar 2012.', ""Slide 13 shows phosphate shipments over time. We estimate that global shipments of phosphate products totaled a record 60 million tonnes in 2011. In 2012, shipments are forecast to climb to yet another record in the 62 million to 64 million tonne range. This forecast includes a recovery in Indian shipments back to close to 2010 levels. Recent statements by the Indian government affirm our view that food security remains a top priority. While we forecast record demand, there still remains several supply uncertainties in 2012. Will the impact of the Arab Spring continue to curtail production in Tunisia, Syria and Egypt? Will Ma'aden's ramp up go as expected? And how much phosphate product will China export?"", 'Despite efforts by the central government to rein in exports, Chinese producers found clever ways to skirt higher duties and ship record amounts of phosphate to offshore destinations in 2011. While the revamped export policy addresses some of these loopholes, the net impact in overall phosphate exports in 2012 remains to be determined.', ""Global MOP shipments are shown on Slide 14. We estimate that global shipments increased to a record 56 million tonnes last year due to large gains in Latin America and all regions of Asia except India. We forecast that shipments this year will climb to another record of 57 million to 59 million tonnes. Asia and Latin America are expected to continue to lead the upward march in global shipments. In these estimates, we are expecting growth in both Indian and Chinese shipments. In looking at 2012 supply dynamics, we expect the commissioning of a limited number of brownfield expansions. The more material expansion tonnes won't come online until 2013 or later."", 'Before we open it up for questions, let me put things into perspective for you. Corn prices are well ahead of historical levels, and farmers are getting powerful signals to produce more. Farm economics remain strong and underpin record global phosphate and potash demand forecasts. There is more confidence among farmers than crop input distributors, as evidenced by large prepaid purchases before year end. These purchases by farmers will eventually end up in our order book. The opportunity in front of Mosaic is readily apparent. The world needs what farmers provide, and we help them deliver. We remain convinced that farmers will demand crop nutrients for both the next application season and in the long term and that we can continue to take advantage of these opportunities.', 'Back to you, Laura.']",management_discussion,MOS_36510

What's driving this? I'm going to ask our economist, Dr. Rahm, to -- who's a keen observer of the -- of these markets to comment. But this is largely being driven by what we're seeing in the fundamentals of the grain and oilseed market: strong corn prices, good and strong oilseed prices. Countries around the world, farmers around the world, all have to step on the accelerator to produce more grains to meet the market signals that is demanding more production for more consumption.

3743,Michael Rahm,"[""Sure. Just to refresh everyone's memory, we're forecasting 62 million to 64 million tonnes of global processed phosphate shipments. Our point estimate, I think, is a hair above 63. In the case of India, our view comes largely from our team on the ground there, and they remain optimistic. And I think if you start from the premise of what's the government of India's overall policy, their policy is to improve food security, to stimulate agricultural productivity growth. And what we've seen this year is that we think that overall phosphate and potash use, given some of the issues with the execution of their subsidy policy, will be down 10% to 15%, and we're beginning to see some unrest in the countryside with respect to large increases, not only in crop nutrient prices but other crop input prices. And then we are confident that the government of India will act to correct some of this.

3744,James T. Prokopanko,"['Lindsay, I\'ll just add one piece to that. You asked about the curtailment and if that is sort of contrary to what we\'re seeing going forward. And that curtailment was largely prompted by what was a virtual stop in purchases of phosphate through the last part of December, and this was -- and I\'ll address this now. I\'m sure questions will come up with some other callers, but we had a period where it was just -- a wall of worry was built around the dealers in North America based on this incessant bad news on the Europe budgetary issues and questions, political questions in North America. And people just stopped buying. December started with some weak grain prices, and that just gave dealers pause, and I think justifiable pause, to say, ""Hey, we\'re just going to hold off buying until we see something, there\'s a catalyst in this market."" Well, by the end of December, we started seeing a catalyst. Grain prices started going up on concerns of South American crop production issues, some drier conditions across the Midwest in the U.S. We\'re seeing some stronger grain prices, and we are absolutely confident that farmers are going to be back in the fields looking to and being incented to plant a record yield. So dealers didn\'t buy. There was limited supplies of product on the river that some people wanted to just blow out of inventory, some of the distributors that didn\'t want to carry inventory given all this uncertainty. Since then, higher grain prices, the anxiety in Europe has moderated a bit and we\'ve got spring coming around the corner in North America. People are back in buying phosphates, and we see in a matter of a week, phosphate prices snap back $50 a tonne. So that isn\'t -- that explains the curtailment, but that doesn\'t change our view and doesn\'t imply anything about our view of the future.']",question_answer,MOS_36510

3754,James T. Prokopanko,"[""So you're asking why no potash curtailment. Well, at present, we don't have a plan, and we don't believe it's necessary for our production plan to include a curtailment, and I'll tell you why. We began our fiscal year June with low inventories coming into the year, on our on-site inventory, on our dealer inventory -- they were low. We'd carefully balanced our production of potash over the summer months and this first 6 months of the fiscal year, and we've done that a couple of things by intention and by -- without intention. For example, our Christmas holiday turnaround, we extended that a couple of days. We had a turnaround in the fall season at Colonsay, a very good turnaround. That took a couple more days than was originally planned. So we've had a few of these minor cutbacks throughout the year, and we find ourselves in great shape in terms of inventory and warehouse capacity. We have room to pile the product. We're not desperate to sell it, and we're prepared for a very good spring with good, balanced inventories. That said, if the market deteriorates, and we don't expect it to deteriorate beyond our current forecast, we can take a curtailment. That could happen very quickly, and we can get an order to do that. Hope that answers your question, Edlain.""]",question_answer,MOS_36510

And then just as a follow-on to that, I know you've been doing more of your contingency selling or floor planning, as you call it. Has that contributed to the reluctance to hold inventories since, in essence, you're doing it for them?

3766,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Okay, 3 questions you snuck in there. About the dealer behavior, I think it's really all about psychology and sentiment. Dropping grain prices at the end of -- at the beginning of December really had people concerned. That said, we're talking about grain prices that were $5 or maybe just under $5. Still good prices, but dealers are just really risk-averse following their 2008 experience. We are seeing dealers now come back. And as recently as yesterday, there's -- we're seeing a good variety of purchasing, whether barges or rail lofts. Dealers see that these are good values. Dealers have -- are going into the season with perhaps more inventory than they had in their warehouses last year. I think it's important to distinguish what kind of inventory they have. They may have -- and we just swag that -- there's no good data. Maybe their warehouses are, let's call, it 50% full. Not all of that is owned by the dealers. Some of that is some of this forward-priced -- to be determined -- price-to-be-determined contracts that we have with the dealers. That hasn't hit our sales book yet. That is in their warehouse, but they don't own it. And so they might have, I don't know, 25% of their warehouses filled with product that is -- they own. And again, that's just a swag and our best efforts at an estimate. The logistics, this is something that the industry has gotten very good at. In a very short compressed period of time working with the railways, working with the dealers, distributors, our production facilities, we managed to move a lot of product through a very short time window. And I've -- in my 30-plus years, I've not seen us not be able to get the product to a dealer in time. There might be some little spot or local outages, but that just hasn't happened in the past, logistics problems, so I don't expect it this year.

So it is attractive. We consume about 1.5 million tonnes of anhydrous ammonia a year. We produce 0.5 million tonnes in our Louisiana facilities for internal consumption. So we are short 1 million tonnes to our internal needs. This is something that's gotten our attention, particularly with the higher prices of ammonia and the good margins being earned. We're interested in getting into the nitrogen ammonia production for internal use. That said, there's some serious challenges there. One, you've -- we would like to find -- ideally find a long-term supply of gas, and that's tough.

The Chinese have been trying to keep more of the phosphate at home, keep phosphate agricultural input costs down in an effort to keep food prices down. They have put in the export tariff regime a couple of years ago, and very creative producers and exporters in China found ways around that. And this time, the national government has -- that's come to their attention. They understand what's being exported, and they are serious about curtailing those exports.

3774,Michael Rahm,"[""Okay. If you look at what's happened, as Jim said, the government of China has been trying to rein in exports and are failing miserably in that task. In 2010, exports surged to about 6.1 million tonnes of DAP/MAP and triple-super phosphate. We think that when all the numbers get counted, that's probably going to increase to at least 6.5 million tonnes when the December numbers come in. You make a good point in terms of what will happen in 2012. The Chinese have gotten around the higher tariffs by exporting more TSP. I think TSP exports will probably increase 90% to 100% this year. They've exported lots of NP products. And if you look at just total phosphate exports in terms of P2O5, Chinese exports will be up an incredible 30%. So certainly, the government's not achieving its policy objective to conserve precious natural resources and the like. We're not -- we don't have an answer in terms of what will happen in 2012. You're correct in that some of the changes in how the policy is implemented will result in higher netbacks on exports to Chinese producers. So there is certainly is an incentive to export less of these other products like TSP and NPs and export more DAP and MAP. So it remains to be seen how that plays out, but one thing is certain. There's going to be a lot more product that needs to be pushed through this eye of the needle that runs from about June 1 through September 30, and we think that there will be some pretty significant logistical challenges, and as a consequence, we're using a lower number in our S&D.""]",question_answer,MOS_36510

Second, we have appealed the entirety of the preliminary injunction, and that is also pending with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. They have granted expedited status, which is discretionary, and oral arguments have been scheduled for the first week in March.

And then finally, we're waiting for a ruling from the District Court judge in Jacksonville on the permit itself. That has been long pending, and we don't know exactly when we're going to get a ruling on that. But we simply need to see what the ruling says to determine any future course of action that we might take.

A couple of years of cutbacks in P&K application rates, they're getting to the end of the rope on that. They're going to start seeing some agronomic impacts and reduced yields because of the reduced rates. And not only are they going to have agronomic impacts, there's going to be political impacts. And that's already starting to show itself in some of the communities, agricultural communities of India where farmers are finding that they aren't getting the returns they need to continue their farm operations, and so you have a political aspect there. Farmers know that they're not applying the right rates of P&K. They're seeing that show up in the revenues that are being diminished at the farm gate, and that is bringing pressure on it.

With us today are Jim Prokopanko, President and Chief Executive Officer; Larry Stranghoener, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Mike Rahm, Vice President, Market and Strategic Analysis and other members of the senior leadership team. We've decided to take a few more minutes of your time with our prepared remarks today to allow a review of our global markets. After my introductory comments, Jim will share our views on Mosaic's results and competitive position. Mike will review global supply and demand trends, and Larry will review our first quarter financial results and outlook.

Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in these forward-looking statements are included in our press release issued yesterday and in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.', ""Now I'd like to turn it over to Jim.""]",management_discussion,MOS_33686
3807,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Thanks, Laura, and welcome everyone. Last week, we pre-released our first quarter results in conjunction with our S&P inclusion offering. As Larry will review with you later, the results reflect the continued fundamental strength of our markets. In fact, this was one of the best first quarters in the history, only surpassed by the extraordinary conditions in 2008. This quarter's strength reflects both favorable market conditions and our focus on execution as we continue to position Mosaic for long-term success. While global GDP trends are uncertain and financial markets are extremely volatile, agricultural markets continue to provide attractive opportunities both near and longer term. We remain confident of our positive outlook."", ""Calendar 2011 is expected to result in yet another year of record U.S. farm income. We believe grain and oilseed prices will continue to reflect growing global demand and the requirement for farmers to increase production to meet that demand. In this environment, we continue to expect strong return for farmers leading to continuing strong results for Mosaic. In addition to strong earnings, we've continued to execute our strategy to capitalize on the positive long-term fundamentals of our business. One of our stated goals for fiscal 2012 is to strengthen our relationships with customers. During this quarter, we completed our annual North American customer survey and achieved a best-in-class rating, the highest score we've received since we started measuring."", 'In Potash, we continue to invest in growing our volumes. Our 5 million tonne expansion program will allow us to remain one of the top potash producers in the world. With over a century of reserves, these brownfield expansions provide economical access and high returns on our investments. We invested $200 million in the first quarter and our aggressive potash expansion program continues to be on time and on budget. The next scheduled capacity comes online in fiscal 2013 at our Esterhazy mine where mechanical construction is nearly complete.', 'The operational excellence campaign that we have successfully deployed in phosphates is now being applied in potash with a focus on improving production rates. This has allowed us to complete the seasonal maintenance turnaround at Esterhazy ahead of schedule, and we are on track with our Colonsay turnaround occurring in our second fiscal quarter.', 'In Phosphates, we continue to improve operating and production efficiency. As an example, total phosphate rock production was up an impressive 20% year-over-year, primarily as a result of a 37% increase in production at our Four Corners mine. As an update on our South Fort Meade litigation, we recently moved a second dragline into Polk County to mine various remnant parcels, while we wait to hear from the federal district court on our permit. Over the past 60 days, we have also advanced several matters with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, including a motion for limited stay to allow uplands-only mining, a request for the 11th Circuit to reinforce its prior ruling and a full appeal of the preliminary injunction. We hope to hear from both courts soon.', 'In the interim, however, our mining operations in Florida have really stepped up their production levels, which together with phosphate rock from our Miski Mayo joint venture and without incremental third-party purchases, have significantly mitigated the impact of the reduced production at South Fort Meade. We expect this will be the case for the remainder of fiscal 2012.', 'In phosphates, our strategy to increase value also includes growing our innovative premium products. Production of MicroEssentials, our premium crop nutrient product continues to grow, reaching a new record in the quarter. We also introduced the first new feed phosphate product in 40 years, Nexfos, which will provide substantial benefits for our customers.', ""Before I turn it over to Mike for a review of global markets, I'd like to acknowledge another step in the orderly distribution of our shares relating to this Cargill transaction. Last week, Mosaic was included in the S&P 500 index, which is an appropriate recognition for a company of our size and stature. As we have previously signaled, S&P 500 inclusion provided us the opportunity to place an additional 20.7 million shares from the Margaret A. Cargill trusts. This substantially reduces the near-term overhang, leaving 21.3 million shares to be sold by the trusts between now and August 2012. We have approached the trust to repurchase these shares, but to-date have not reached an agreement. As of today, we see no investment in our industry more compelling than our own shares. As a reminder, during the first 2 years after the Cargill transaction, we can only purchase shares from the trusts."", ""I'll return for some concluding remarks. But now, I'd like to turn it over to Dr. Mike Rahm for a review of our global markets. Mike?""]",management_discussion,MOS_33686
3808,Michael Rahm,"[""Thank you, Jim, and good morning, everyone. Let's begin with the outlook for agricultural commodity markets. There's a tug-of-war taking place between powerful outside market influences and strong agricultural commodity fundamentals. Our assessment is that agricultural commodity fundamentals are just too strong not to win this contest. Let me explain why."", ""First, markets fret way too much about the impact of a potential economic slowdown on food demand. As this chart shows, global grain and oilseed demand is marching upward at an accelerating pace and it didn't miss a step during the great global recession. Use increased 2.1% in '08, '09 or right in line with the compound annual growth rate for the decade. The USDA currently forecasts that demand will increase 2.2% in '11, '12 and that follows a 2.4% increase in '10, '11."", ""Second, agricultural commodity markets must bid for more acres in 2012, and then hope that mother nature cooperates in order to prevent another drawdown in global inventories. This chart shows that grain and oilseed stocks are projected to decline for a second year in a row in '11, '12, despite the extraordinarily strong price signals since mid-2010. The world needs a stronger supply response in 2012."", 'Of the major crops, corn is the poster child for tight agricultural commodity markets. Both global and U.S. inventories, as a percentage of use, are projected to decline to the second lowest percentage in modern history. As a result, we estimate that the market will need to bid for 93 million to 95 million acres of corn from the United States next spring. As you can see from this slide, the positive outlook for agricultural commodities underpins record phosphate and potash demand forecasts. In the case of phosphate, we estimate that global shipments of the leading solid products will increase to 60 million to 61 million tonnes in 2011 and to 62 million to 64 million tonnes in 2012. In the case of potash, we now estimate that global MOP shipments will increase to 56 million to 57 million tonnes this year and then to 58 million to 60 million tonnes in 2012.', ""Now let's review the situation and outlook in a few key geographies. In North America, 2012 new crop prices continue to trade at high levels and farm economics remain highly profitable. That is evident in recent farm income estimates. The USDA now estimates that U.S. net cash farm income will surge to a record $115 billion in 2011, up 24% from the record last year. The agency also projects that expenditures on crop nutrients will climb to a record $26.2 billion in 2011, up $3.6 billion from the previous record in 2008."", ""The stars and moons look aligned for an outstanding fall application season. In fact, as you can see from this chart, we project that fall application this year will at least match the spectacular season a year ago and exceed the 5-year average by a significant margin. In the case of phosphate, North American shipments of the leading solid products are projected to total 9 million to 9.5 million short tonnes in '11, '12. Our current point estimate is 9.4 million and we estimate that assuming a normal application window, shipments for fall application will total 4.5 million short tonnes and shipments for the spring season will total 4.9 million tonnes."", ""In the case of potash, North American MOP shipments are forecast to total 10.5 million to 11 million short tonnes in '11, '12. Our current point estimate is 10.8 million and we estimate that shipments for fall application will total 4.7 million short tonnes and shipments for the spring season will total 6.1 million short tonnes."", 'In South America, agricultural commodity markets are counting on this region to produce a bumper crop this year. The planting season is not off to an early start in some regions due to the development of another La Niña weather pattern. In Brazil, high commodity prices and the recent weakening of the real have boosted farm profitability, as well as prospects for record crop nutrient shipments this year. Total crop nutrient shipments now are forecast to climb to a record 26.2 million to 26.7 million tonnes this year, up from 24.6 million tonnes last year. Brazil is expected to import record or near-record volumes of potash and phosphate this year. This chart shows that MOP imports are projected to increase to a record 6.8 million to 7 million tonnes this year, and then increase to 7 million to 7.2 million tonnes in 2012. Imports of the leading solid phosphate products are forecast to climb to 3.6 million to 3.7 million tonnes this year and remain in that range in 2012.', ""In India, another good monsoon has bolstered the agricultural outlook, despite large expected increases in retail DAP and MOP prices this year. In the case of potash, our latest tally indicates that importers have contracted for about 5.8 million tonnes of MOP for delivery during the '11, '12 fiscal year. And we estimate that shipments in calendar year 2011 likely will reach 4.8 million to 5.2 million tonnes, off from the record 6.3 million tonnes last year but much greater than expectations just a couple of months ago. Imports are forecast to climb to a record 6.3 million to 6.5 million tonnes in 2012."", 'In the case of phosphate, we project that overall phosphate use will increase slightly this year but DAP consumption will decline moderately due mainly to delays in settling contract prices and reduced availability from China. DAP shipments are forecast to total 10.4 million to 10.6 million tonnes this year, and DAP/MAP imports are projected to total to 7 million to 7.2 million tonnes in 2011 and then rebound to 7.7 million to 7.9 million tonnes in 2012.', 'In China, farm economics remained favorable and underpinned good domestic P&K demand prospects. Domestic phosphate and potash shipments are forecast to increase 8% and 6%, respectively this year. Potash imports are estimated to climb to 5.8 million to 6 million tonnes this year, and then increase to 6 million to 6.5 million tonnes in 2012. Exports of the leading phosphate products are forecast to drop to 5.2 million to 5.4 million tonnes this year, off from a record 6.1 million tonnes in 2010 and remain about stable at 5.1 million to 5.4 million tonnes in 2012.', 'In summary, we expect that strong agricultural commodity fundamentals will win the current tug-of-war, and this victory will underpin record crop nutrient demand forecasts.', 'Now over to you, Larry.']",management_discussion,MOS_33686
3809,Lawrence W. Stranghoener,"[""Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. As you can see on Slide 18, there's been no change in our reported numbers since our prerelease last week. As Jim said, we had very strong first quarter results. Because of the confidence of farmers and distributors and the strength of the fall application season, we shipped large volumes in the first fiscal quarter. This compares to last year, when a significant portion of fall application shipments fell into the second fiscal quarter. Many distributor warehouses are fully stocked in preparation for a blockbuster fall season. Earnings in the quarter were $526 million or $1.17 per share compared to $298 million or $0.67 per share a year ago. Included in these earnings were several notable expense items, which lowered earnings by $0.04 per share after tax as detailed in the press release. We generated an impressive $554 million in operating cash flow this quarter. This is flat with last year, as the impact of stronger earnings was offset by a decline in the impact of customer prepayments. We invested $391 million in capital expenditures with over half of this going toward our potash extensions, and we continue to maintain a very strong capital and cash position with over $4 billion in cash and cash equivalents."", 'As for our financial policies, we continue to target a minimum $1.5 billion liquidity buffer and sufficient balance sheet strength to maintain our current credit ratings. This will provide ample flexibility to take advantage of potential opportunities. Our priorities for cash deployment remain the same, investing in the business, investing in strategic opportunities and returning capital to shareholders. With respect to that latter point, note that we are ready, willing and eager to repurchase the remaining 21.3 million shares that the Margaret A. Cargill trust may sell in the near future, and have offered to do so as we believe our stock price represents a compelling value at current price levels. As it turns out, the trusts also recognize value and have indicated they are unwilling to sell additional shares at this time at current prices. We will maintain a dialogue with the trust with whom we have a good relationship on this topic.', ""Now let's talk about segment results. Our Potash segment showed strong results in the first quarter. Potash operating earnings were $402 million, up over $184 million from last year as highlighted on Slide 19. This improvement was primarily due to increased selling prices and volumes and a 19 percentage point increase in operating rates, partially offset by higher Canadian resource taxes and royalties."", ""Moving on to Phosphates as summarized on Slide 20. We generated $333 million in operating earnings compared to $178 million a year ago, an increase of 87%. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to increased selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Gross margin was 18% compared to 15% last year. As expected, gross margin was negatively impacted by raw material costs while we continued to aggressively pursue efficiency improvements in controllable costs. Mosaic's margin in international distribution remains high, reflecting overall positive price trends and our focus on capturing margin opportunities in a rising price environment."", 'We recognize that understanding phosphate cost of goods sold is one of the bigger challenges for investors. Ammonia, sulfur and phosphate rock are key inputs to our finished products with cost driven by market prices of these key commodities. A complicating factor is a lag between published spot prices and when those prices are reflected in cost of goods sold. This chart shows the drivers of the margin change from the fourth quarter of last year to the first quarter. First, higher sulfur and ammonia prices lowered gross margins sequentially by 3 percentage points including the outage at our Faustina ammonia plant. Faustina historically provides about 1/3 of our ammonia needs, and the outage increased cost by $15 million in the quarter. Second, a change in sales mix as a result of increased international sales reduced margin by approximately 2 percentage points. Third, lower mine production levels and chemical plant turnarounds lowered gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point. And fourth, higher phosphate rock costs negatively impacted gross margin by approximately 1 percentage point, primarily due to the impact of Miski Mayo rock replacing Florida rock. Recall that Miski Mayo rock comes into cost of goods sold at close to market prices with an expected future offset in equity income.', 'Going forward, we expect the second quarter phosphate margin to remain comparable to the first quarter. Our ammonia plant is scheduled to come back online in October, ramping up to full production in November. This will be timely in light of continued tight supply-demand dynamics for ammonia. The third quarter will also reflect higher ammonia cost due to the lag between raw material purchases and recognition and cost of goods sold. We expect Faustina to provide the normal benefit to cost of goods sold in the fourth fiscal quarter.', ""Now let me shift to our financial outlook and guidance for the next quarter as summarized on Slide 22. As we have already seen in first quarter shipments, we expect the fall application season to be as good as or better than last year's strong season. Assuming weather cooperates; distributors will soon begin to replenish inventories for the balance of fall requirements. For our second quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate total potash sales volumes of 1.7 million to 2.1 million tonnes and an average MOP selling price of $440 to $465 per tonne. This average price reflects our expectation of a higher percentage of standard product in our international sales mix, which lowers the average price. We expect to run our potash mines for the second quarter between 80% and 90% of operating capacity, up from the first quarter but slightly impacted by turnaround activities at our Colonsay mine."", 'In our Phosphates segment for the second quarter, we estimate total sales volumes of 3.1 million to 3.5 million tonnes at an average DAP selling price of $600 to $625 per tonne. The most recent pricing of the PhosChem India contract narrows the spread between this base load contract and current spot prices. To meet continued high demand, we expect to operate our North American phosphate plants in excess of 85% of granulation capacity. As I indicated earlier, second quarter margins in this segment are expected to remain comparable with the first quarter due to higher raw material costs flowing through cost of goods sold.', 'Our annual guidance for capital expenditures, Canadian resource taxes and royalties, SG&A and the effective tax rate have not changed. For those of you interested in modeling, note that we have provided an appendix to the slide deck with additional thoughts for how to model Canadian resource taxes.', ""With that, I'd like to now turn it back to Jim.""]",management_discussion,MOS_33686
3810,James T. Prokopanko,"[""We continue to believe strongly in the near- and long-term opportunities in crop nutrients. Over the past 40 years, global demand for grains and oilseeds has declined twice; in both cases, as a result of lack of supply issues and prices, rationing demand. Economic uncertainty has historically, not impacted demand and we've yet to see any impact on our customer sentiments. At Mosaic, we intend to continue to take advantage of these opportunities; our best-in-class assets, effective execution and a rock-solid balance sheet gives us the flexibility to invest, grow and unlock value for our shareholders.

3813,Donald Carson,"[""Mike Rahm, a question for you on the corn side. The USDA has been very aggressive in cutting demand as they -- to offset their production cuts. Just wondering what you think of some of those demand cuts, and are stocks really tighter that what they're reporting? I mean as an example, they have export demand below the '09 recession level. They cut residual by $200 million, so I just want to get your opinion as to what's really going on with corn demand and how tight the situation really is.""]",question_answer,MOS_33686

3815,Michael Rahm,"[""Yes, USDA has cut huge amounts of use out of their recent estimates. And you're right, many people question if those are legitimate. And certainly, when you look at everything from some of the processing margins, then ethanol and so forth, you wonder whether or not prices are high enough to eliminate that much demand. The other interesting point that I know you're aware of is the fact that expectations in the October 12 report are that USDA is probably going to cut 400,000 to 500,000 acres out of their harvested area estimate based on FSA estimates. So the corn market is extremely tight. There's no question about that, and I think there's some positive fundamental news still to come in the corn market. And that said, there are good reports coming from, I guess, better reports coming out of fields in terms of the current crop. So that may offset some of that, but you're right in that.

You stated that North American phosphate demand is expected to match last year's levels, usage in other regions also expected to be high.

Can you provide some color around your assumptions?""]",question_answer,MOS_33686
3820,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Sure, Elaine. Both potash and phosphate have some variance from the norm year-to-year, depending on seasonal swings and timing that revenue recognition matters that come over not just the current but maybe the last 2 quarters.

The issue with phosphates is frankly, all round timing and I'd preface my remarks with the fact that on our phosphate volumes, last year's Q2 was the biggest Phosphates segment volume that we've had since the start of Mosaic. So it's a bit -- it's not representative of the norm. The second piece is that where we're expecting lower volumes is in our international distribution segment, where we have consciously a lower program going on in India. And in Brazil, we had anticipations of volumes that some of them will move into our Q4. So frankly, we expect a strong Phosphates segment move and are looking forward to that.

3823,Mark W. Connelly,"[""Jim, just trying to dig into the Phosphate business a little more. Your crop nutrient blend business has been growing faster than some of the other segments for a while. Can you give us a sense of whether that's something we can expect to continue? And also, are the margins in that business as good as your regular business?""]",question_answer,MOS_33686
3824,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Mark, I'll talk about the margins, and I'm going to let Rick talk about the blend and the mix of our blend fertilizers. Margins on the Phosphates have been strong, and with we believe to be some further upside potential. And the reason we see the upside potential is a strong rock-solid grain fundamentals currently and into the foreseeable future at least the next crop, as well as a tight fertilizer S&D particularly among the phosphates side of the business. So if it weren't for some macroeconomic uncertainties that's going around the world and that includes dealers and farmers who are just moderately more cautionary about what they do with inventories, we would see, I think, some potential for some greater upside on the margins. But when I do say there's -- the macroeconomics are affecting the psychology, it's just more care in consideration of the risk that's going forward. Nobody in the ag marketplace is seeing weakening grain prices, materially weakening below the kind of levels we have now and we see it's necessary to keep these prices going forward, and farmers want to grow the volumes necessary to restore the S&D to a safer level. So we're seeing some upside potential on the phosphate margins and we just need to work through and resolve some of these macroeconomic concerns.

3830,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Yes, Jeff.

In the meantime, raw material costs have continued to increase, and we have yet to see the full impact of those increases in cost of goods sold.

And on the demand side, obviously, with the prospect of 93 million or 95 million acres of corn, certainly in the U.S., there is the expectation of a very strong fall application needs. And in the case of phosphate, phosphate markets have rebounded and the demand to produce ammonium phosphate continues to climb as well.

And I think this is a good point why we -- it just highlights our interest and continued interest in expanding our ammonia production. We presently produce -- consume, we presently consume 1.5 million tonnes of ammonia a year in the production of phosphates. We are self-sufficient with Faustina to the extent of 1/3 or 500,000 tonnes, and we're left with about 1 million tonne hole to fill with -- on the open market.

3843,James T. Prokopanko,"[""Your question was really breaking up. I'll address what I think you asked, which is about the mechanics of the remaining shares to be sold. As I think you know, after the original 115 million share deal, we had another 42 million shares to be sold into the market between the original close at late May and 15 months. We thought all along and we had signaled that if and when we became a member of the S&P 500, if we could move quickly enough, we could facilitate an S&P 500 inclusion trade, allowing the trust to sell a portion of those 42 million shares and we were able to accomplish that last week, a very successful deal that cleaned up another 20.7 million shares. That leaves the trust with 21.3 million shares that are still subject to a lock-up agreement that will expire in mid-November. At that time, if those shares have not been disposed of otherwise, we are obligated to facilitate a secondary offering of those shares within the next 3 months following the expiration of that lock up. As we indicated in our prepared comments, we are prepared to, we're willing to, we're eager to, we've offered to repurchase those shares from the trust to just get them off the market. We thought that would be of interest to the trust, the deal was designed with the expectation that they would be looking for liquidity and diversification as quickly as possible. As we said though at this current time with these prices, they are not a willing seller. So we'll maintain a dialogue. We think this overhang issue has been greatly reduced by the success of the initial offering and now this S&P inclusion trade that we've accomplished, and we'll do our best to make sure that the remaining 21.3 million shares doesn't present a significant overhang as well. I hope that addresses the question, Vincent. If not obviously, follow up after the call.""]",question_answer,MOS_33686

Over the 30 years of my career in agriculture, the visibility, understanding and appreciation for what this industry provides to the world has increased dramatically.', 'Fiscal 2011 marks the highest net earnings in the history of Mosaic. Our performance in fiscal 2011 clearly demonstrated our company-wide commitment to success. For Mosaic, 2011 was a year of progress on many fronts as we continued investing to maintain our industry-leading stature, aggressively pursued operational excellence initiatives and positioned ourselves to enhance our shareholder value through strong cash generation and efficient capital allocation.', 'We capped off the year with one of the most dramatic changes since the founding of the company with the exit of Cargill as a majority shareholder. Though there are still steps to complete, we believe the additional flexibility this transaction provides will allow us to maximize the value of this business and lead to higher returns for shareholders.', ""Moving to Slide 4. As we look ahead to fiscal 2012 and beyond, we see a fabulous long-term story. In spite of the ups and downs of commodity markets, the food security challenge is not going away. The crop nutrients we provide are a vital ingredient required to help meet the world's growing demand for grains and oilseeds. Over the past few months, agricultural markets have been very volatile."", 'We expect grain and oilseed markets to remain tight and highly sensitive to weather and political developments. Our overall assessment for agriculture commodities is for greater upside pricing than downside. In spite of this near-term volatility, the long-term trends hold. The world requires record yields and harvested area to maintain inventories at secure levels.', 'Crop nutrients are necessary to the deliver the required yields. And as a result, we see continued strong demand for crop nutrients for this foreseeable future. In the near term, we expect very good North American fall application and South American spring planting seasons. We are essentially sold out of potash and phosphate for the next several months.', 'For Potash, we estimate global MOP shipments will climb to a record 55 million to 58 million tonnes in calendar 2011. Shipments are forecast to grow to between 70 million and 73 million tonnes by 2020 or 3% to 3.5% annually. Even with significant brownfield expansion tonnes expected to come online over the next 10 years, we expect demand growth to absorb the additional supply resulting in historically high global operating rates.', 'We estimate global phosphate shipments will reach a record 60 million to 62 million tonnes in calendar 2011. Over the next decade, phosphate shipments are expected to grow to between 75 million and 79 million tonnes by 2020 or 2.5% to 3% annually.', ""In Phosphate, several factors have served to strengthen the market. The implementation of a new export tariff regime in China has reduced exports significantly below last year's level. In addition, political uncertainty has reduced supplies from Tunisia and Syria, and the market is watching how quickly Ma'aden ramps up production."", 'Challenges at our South Fort Meade mine add additional supply concerns. These near-term uncertainties reinforce the need for additional supply to meet long-term demand growth. Our projections indicate global operating rates over the next decade will increase slightly and remain at healthy levels.', 'Key growth regions for crop nutrients demand will continue to be Asia and Latin America, especially China, India and Brazil. To meet these projected increases, potash and phosphate producers will need to produce at high rates and deliver significant new capacity.', ""At Mosaic, we are strongly positioned to take advantage of the global opportunities I've just described. The quality of our production assets, the execution capabilities of our employees and the strength of our capital base will allow us to create value for shareholders and set us apart from the competition."", 'The first of these items is that our assets are among the best in the industry. Over the past 5-year period, Mosaic produced more phosphate and potash crop nutrients than any other producer in the world.', 'In Potash, our mines are in very stable geopolitical locations and place Mosaic among the top potash producers in the world with reserves projected to last over a century. In fact, what most investors did not realize is that over the last 5 years, including the Esterhazy total production, Mosaic has mined more potash ore and milled more finished potash products than any other company in the world. Our brownfield expansions remain on track to add an additional 5 million tonnes of capacity over the next decade. These capacity additions will ensure that we maintain our industry-leading position.', 'In Phosphates, our world-class facilities are among the lowest cost in the industry, with attractive locations in the U.S. on the Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River, providing advantage to access to global regions and raw materials. Our geographic distribution reach is unmatched with people and facilities on the ground in the most important crop nutrient markets.', 'We have leading positions in our premium products business, which is continuing to grow with dramatic increases in sales of MicroEssentials and Pegasus. These products will continue to differentiate Mosaic and provide great value for our customers as they seek higher yields.', 'Second, we have a proven ability to execute and focus on operational excellence. Our Potash expansion initiative, comprised of 9 distinct projects and $5 billion in capital spending, is on time, on scope and on budget. We have over 1,200 employees and contractors working on these large, complex initiatives. Our focus on operational excellence showed impressive results as we improve processes and have positively impacted production costs.', 'We are improving energy efficiency, maintenance processes and mining production at a variety of sites. Through these and other initiatives, our Phosphates team largely overcame the production shortfall at our South Fort Meade mine during the 2011 fiscal year.', ""As an aside, last week I was in Florida and was impressed more than I've ever been with the progress on all these initiatives. We have fresh people in new positions who are energized and eager to drive improved performance. This focus on operational excellence has truly taken hold as a way of life at Mosaic."", 'Finally, the third area of focus in creating value is efficient capital allocation. Mosaic has one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry, which provides significant value-creation opportunity. After ensuring a strong financial foundation, including an appropriate liquidity buffer, our first priority is to invest in growing our business.', 'The most prominent example is our Potash expansions. In Phosphates, we are investing in increasing our premium product capacity. Our second investment priority is to continue seeking strategic opportunities, particularly phosphate investments that will expand our sources of phosphate rock. Any investments we make are expected to generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital and as a result, to generate shareholder value.', 'Efficient capital allocation is not just about investing in the business, it includes returning capital to shareholders. With the exit of our majority shareholder, we have greater flexibility with respect to shareholder distributions and more so once we are beyond the tax restriction period related to the Cargill transaction. As we move forward, we will seek to optimize our capital structure while maintaining the flexibility to capitalize on new investment opportunities.', ""Before I turn this over to Larry, let me touch on the most recent developments at South Fort Meade. The federal district court recently issued another preliminary injunction, which temporarily prevents mining activities in Hardee County. This includes uplands mining, even though the plaintiffs and the court previously indicated that they did not object to this and the Army Corps concurred that no federal permit is required to engage in such activities in the uplands. We have yet to receive a decision on the underlying merits of this case. We believe the court's issuance of a second preliminary injunction is simply wrong and inconsistent with the mandate given by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals in April, namely to resolve this matter in 90 days and view it through a lens requiring substantial deference to the Army Corps in determining whether it came to a rational permit decision."", ""Given the thoroughness and high quality of the administrative record over 7 years of review, we strongly believe this standard was met. While we wait for the district court's final ruling, we have appealed a preliminary injunction and will be seeking an expedited stay from the Eleventh Circuit. We hope to have an answer to this request in the fall. In the meantime, Mosaic will continue to seek ways to mitigate the adverse consequences of this ruling through mining our other mines at the highest possible rates, use of existing inventories, accessing phosphate rock from our Miski Mayo joint venture and supplementing with rock purchases if necessary."", ""Going forward, given the activism on South Fort Meade and what we've learned through this process, we are in the process of accelerating our future permit applications, and we'll pursue them on a concurrent basis. I want to emphasize that we have very healthy working relationships with the local, state and federal regulators who issue our permits, and we have every expectation that we will receive all of the permits needed to mine our valuable mineral interest in the decades ahead."", ""Now I'll turn the call over to Larry.""]",management_discussion,MOS_32114
3883,Lawrence Stranghoener,"['Thanks, Jim, and good morning everyone. As Jim said, both the near-term and long-term fundamentals for our business remains strong, and we are effectively executing against our strategic priorities.', 'Yesterday, we reported the highest annual net earnings in the history of the company with strong results in both of our business segments. Excluding the gains on asset sales in all periods, 2011 had net earnings second only to 2008 when we experienced unprecedented market conditions.', 'Now let me highlight our fourth quarter financial results. As you can see on Slide 7, net earnings were $649 million or $1.45 per share compared to $396 million or $0.89 per share a year ago. We generated nearly $1 billion in operating cash flow this quarter and invested $366 million in capital expenditures, with the bulk of this going toward our Potash expansions. Gross margin was a strong 35%. Included in fourth quarter earnings were several discrete expense items outlined in our press release, which lowered our reported results by $52 million pretax or $0.07 per share.', 'Our Potash segments showed strong fourth quarter results. Potash operating earnings were $469 million, up over $120 million from last year, as highlighted on Slide 8. This improvement was primarily due to increased selling prices and volumes, partially offset by higher Canadian resource taxes and royalties. Reported gross margin was 53%. But excluding Canadian resource taxes, gross margin was 63%, 3 points higher than a year ago. North American producer inventories remain below average, and demand fundamentals continue to be robust, resulting in rising prices for our products.', ""As an update to the legal dispute with Potash Corp. regarding our tolling agreement, we have been required to maintain the status quo by the Saskatchewan Court, and we'll provide potash at cost until the beginning of trial scheduled for January 2012. We believe our obligation under the tolling agreement has ended. If we prevail in the lawsuit, Potash Corp. has agreed to pay damages to Mosaic."", 'Moving on to Phosphates, as summarized on Slide 9. We generated $370 million in operating earnings compared to $221 million a year ago. Gross margin was 25%, similar to last year. The increase in operating earnings was primarily due to increased selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. As Jim noted in his comments, our focus on operational excellence contributed to our strong performance over the past few quarters, with mining performance especially notable.', 'Now let me shift to our financial outlook and guidance for the next quarter as summarized on Slide 10. For our first quarter fiscal 2012, we estimate total Potash sales volumes of 1.7 million to 1.9 million tonnes and an average MOP selling price of $430 to $455 per tonne. We expect to run our Potash mines for the first quarter between 75% and 85% of operating capacity, down from the fourth quarter due to planned seasonal maintenance turnarounds. As we have seen in prior years, we expect the seasonally lower operating rates to result in higher per tonne costs and a lower gross margin percentage for the quarter, as fixed costs are spread over lower production volumes.', 'In our Phosphates segment. For the first quarter, we estimate total phosphate sales volumes of 3.0 million to 3.3 million tonnes and an average DAP selling price of $560 to $590 per tonne. To meet continued high demand, we expect to operate our North American phosphate plants in excess of 85% of granulation capacity.

They take soil tests in the U.S., and they know what their soil fertility rates are. They've got great cash flows, good incomes, good returns forecast basis the Chicago commodity prices going into the 2012 year. So the incentive there is there for them to apply.

We're always in maybe not formal negotiations but we're always in discussions with our customers about forward needs, and that's the case here with phosphate. We're continuing -- we're talking with them. The discussions are getting more serious, and I anticipate a satisfactory conclusion to those discussions in the next month or 2. Now why did India potash and phosphate approach diverge? Hard to really explain what was in the mind of the Indian negotiators on this. We were very clear. We had an offer out on the Potash since before the conclusion of that agreement, which was April of this past year. The only thing I would say is the subsidy programs were somewhat more restrictive as it impacted the potash. They thought they had a position that they could successfully argue in regards to potash pricing. We were prepared to sell, but they chose to defer coming to an agreement to at which point, we were starting to come short of potash for the balance of the year. Canpotex has a budgeted amount of tonnes that they set up for the year. They look at the markets and the customers that they're going to. And as demand continued to be strong and grow through the year, it was becoming clear that there wasn't going to be sufficient product for both India and China if both delayed. China booked right at the conclusion of their agreement in June, potash agreement, and India deferred. And in the meantime, product was purchased by other markets.

We have every confidence that the South Fort Meade permit was, as originally issued, was issued properly. And we're confident that with time, the South Fort Meade permit will be issued. I said in my comments, the district judge was simply wrong in his judgment regarding both the merits of the permit and made an error in the issuance of another preliminary injunction on the uplands mining. To give you some more color, we've engaged some of the most knowledgeable, capable attorneys, outside counsels on this matter. One is a Florida firm and the other is a Washington, D.C. law firm, both experts on these matters. After the surprise ruling, we've had the judge's ruling, and some of our work that we've done leading up to this, reviewed by some outside, outside firms, all of whom report back just to ensure that we're on the right track. All of the firms reported back that our position is sound, correct, and the law is on our side.

And they've shared with us that their work tells us that the -- tells them that the law is on Mosaic's side. In short, we're struggling to find a legal opinion that supports the judge or the plaintiff's position on this matter. So again, we come down to a view that this is just a matter of timing. It's not if we're going to prevail, just simply a matter of when we're going to prevail. And I think Larry and Joc -- Joc will tell you more about some of the very innovative and resourceful approaches our mining teams and production teams in Florida have gone to, to ensure that we're going to mitigate for the period of time ahead of us, a good period of time ahead of us what the impact of losing access to South Fort Meade is. Now, Joc, if you would just add some color to the rock sourcing.""]",question_answer,MOS_32114
3915,James O'Rourke,"[""Okay. So back to just give a little more detail on the rock sourcing. First of all, our first opportunity is look at our other operations and maximize the output from them. We've been working from an operational excellence perspective on those operations for about 1.5 years now. So at the Four Corners mine, we have done a big debottlenecking project such that we're looking at producing about 20% extra out of that operation, which really should be able to push it. And if you read our 10-K, we're actually already pushing it beyond what is its nameplate capacity. So we're going to continue to push that operation very hard. That will help mitigate short and long term. Wingate mine, another smaller mine -- but again, looking at how we can push that in the short term and then on the long term. It's a dredge operation, we'll be increasing the size of those dredges to really push that operation. Again, that helps mitigate. At the Miski Mayo joint venture, as I mentioned, we're going to take about 1 million tonne, just over 1 million tonne of phosphate rock from that joint venture. But that is also in discussions with our partners, Vale and Mitsui, as to an expansion, which was always part of the plan for Miski Mayo. So we are planning on an expansion there at some point. Again, that will change our long-term rock needs. So if you take all of that, it's probably too early to say what we're going to look like after fiscal 2012. But certainly, even from our first look at this, we're a lot better off.

So we would evaluate that. I'd finally note as well that as the largest phosphate producer in the world, there's not a deposit in the world that we're probably -- that we're not aware of. Every week, it seems, I get a proposal from somebody suggesting that we look at this deposit or the next deposit. And who's to say whether any of those have merits or not.

Note that PCS Corp. being a Canadian domicile company reports resource taxes as separate from cost of goods sold. In our case, it's included in cost of goods sold.

As we've said before, China has played an important role in meeting kind of the surges in demand that occurred in 2007 and again in 2010. With the implementation of a more, what I'd call, progressive export tax, our team believes that DAP/MAP triple exports will drop to about 5 million tonnes in 2011. It's probably important to distinguish between DAP/MAP exports and TSP or triple exports. In 2010, China exported 4.9 million tonnes of DAP/MAP. We expect that to drop to about 3.6 million tonnes, so a 1.3 million tonne decline in DAP/MAP exports. And if you look at statistics from China customs for the first 5 months of this year, DAP/MAP exports have dropped about 9%. Triple exports have increased about 96% from China. Triple exports are not subject to the same progressive export tax. So bottom line in terms of the phosphate market, the way we like to summarize it is we think that import demand will increase about 1.1 million tonnes this year.

3932,James O'Rourke,"[""Joc O'Rourke here. The capacity increases, and I think those are laid out fairly well in the 10-K. But just so that you understand how they come on, the Esterhazy operation will finish its first phase of expansion early in calendar 2012. So the end of this fiscal year, we should see production from it and it's a total of 600,000 tonnes. We should start seeing production from early in the calendar 2012, and then ramping up to its full capacity about the fall of 2012. The next one off the mark is Belle Plaine. Belle Plaine is coming in not long after that in sort of the end of 2012 calendar year. And then finally, Colonsay, which will completed by the end of 2012, and it will come online early calendar 2013. Then a little longer down the road, we have the Esterhazy, which includes our K3, the Esterhazy Phase 3, which includes the K3 operation. That adds another 900,000 tonnes to Esterhazy, but that won't be coming until circa 2017. The other 2 in that, which help take us up to the 16 are a second expansion of Belle Plaine, which is right now in the final feasibility stage, and a further expansion of Colonsay, which is in the feasibility stage right now. So those will come in pretty much year by year for the next 3 years. And then after that, we have a gap until about 2015, 2017 where the next phase starts coming in.""]",question_answer,MOS_32114

3934,David Silver,"[""A couple of questions. First, I was hoping that maybe Mike or someone there could provide an update on your view of how the Ma'aden facility is ramping up and whether we look at marketing agreements or what is it that you're looking at that you're using as a basis for their productive capability? And then second, I'm going to apologize in advance for a long question, but I'm listening to discussions of South Fort Meade and the legal back and forth that's going on. And in the back of my mind, I'm thinking that the value of rock in the ground is only rising as these issues go on. And we haven't mentioned Ona or Pine Level in quite a while. And, Jim, I'm just wondering if you could maybe comment on how you view your current strategy with South Fort Meade and if you could relate it to how you think the company can best exploit the reserves, the substantial reserves yet to be mined and that ultimately you'll be relying on in the not-too-distant future. If that's not too vague a question.""]",question_answer,MOS_32114

3936,Michael Rahm,"[""Yes. You probably the read the same reports we have. There was a report over the weekend that they achieved a total production of 50,000 tonnes since their start up on June 17. Expectations that they shipped their first vessel of product to India loads next week. In our S&D, we expect that they'll produce somewhere in that 400,000 to 450,000 tonnes of product in the second half of the year. If you look at a survey of analysts, I think the number ranges from 200,000 tonnes to 500,000 tonnes. In 2012, we have been ramping up, and I think exporting something in the neighborhood of 2.2 million tonnes. So that's our expectation. And including that in the S&D, from our perspective, it continues to look balanced to snug. So I think, and we've always said, that if there's a surprise that they don't deliver on those types of quantities that it turns out to be a positive surprise at least in the near term.""]",question_answer,MOS_32114
3937,James Prokopanko,"[""Okay, thanks, Mike. David, I'm going to answer your question about value of rock, and then I'm going to ask Rich Mack to discuss our plan for getting additional permits and how we're going to manage our properties in Florida. You're absolutely right to conclude that the value of rock is not getting cheaper and is getting more costly. And this applies to both phosphate as it does to potash. Mining of any material is the most economic reserves, have been found and are being exploited and are being developed. And those are the first ones that the market finds and that's what we have, whether it's our potash in Saskatchewan, our phosphates in Florida. Our costs are low by global standards, what it's traded for, our delivered costs for our own mined rock. And we've got great mines, good reserves and short distances to haul the -- or to the processing and granulation facilities. As we look around the world, Larry mentioned that we get regular calls to look at rocks in whether it's in Kazakhstan or in West Africa. These are not cheap places to develop. And we're seeing that no matter where we go, that the next round of phosphate rock developments are going to be much higher. And whether it's in existing facilities as in Florida, where mining is not permitting -- it's a fact, it's not getting easier but it's attainable, and we are getting our permits and will get our permits to places in North Africa, where you see issues around existing deposits with social unrest, civil unrest, challenges whether it's Tunisia, Syria or Morocco. It's getting more expensive to operate mineral extraction businesses around the world, whether it's permitting, community costs or environmental costs. Costs are going up and anticipate that to be a case as we go forward. We have 30, 35 years of proven and probable reserves in Florida. We expect we're going to get the permits for that. And DeSoto and Ona are the next 2 on the docket, and I'll have Rich describe what work is being done to obtain those permits.""]",question_answer,MOS_32114
3938,Richard Mack,"[""Thanks, Jim. We have every expectation that we will get our permits that will allow us to continue our operations for the next 30 to 35 years, as Jim noted. Just maybe a couple of things as background and perspective on this. First, we have great working relationships, professional working relationships with our regulators on the local county level, on the state level and at the Army Corps level. And obviously, in terms of a strategy, we have to continue to ensure that these relationships are maintained professionally, and we can get permits to go through these organizations on a timely basis. Second, as an observation, I would also say that we believe that the Army Corps of Engineers is much better positioned today than compared to as recently as 3 years ago. They have a phosphate mining team. They have more resources. They, certainly, with the frustration on the South Fort Meade litigation and after all of the work that they exerted only to be caught up in a legal process, understand the importance of phosphate rock and what it means to U.S. agriculture and to U.S. trade. We are going to be working on these major permits in the future on a concurrent basis rather than a sequential basis. I think if you go back and take a critical look at the last, say, 5 to 7 years, that's typically how these permits have been processed, more sequentially, not as much concurrently. And that was particularly true when you had the significant economic boom in, say, 2006 and 2007 when the Army Corps was busy working on other development activities. But in the end, and just maybe closing out with South Fort Meade, if there is a frustrating part of the process, it's that you are in a process. Litigation, you have to play by the rules of civil procedure. And the important point on South Fort Meade, and I think it's important for everybody to step back and just take note, is whether or not the court came to a rational permitting decision. That is the standard. And as the Eleventh Circuit said, that has to be exceedingly deferential standard. In other words, the judge or a court cannot substitute its judgment for that of the agency who processes these permits on a daily basis. And if you take a look at just some of the statistics related to South Fort Meade and the same will happen, for example, in Ona or in DeSoto, the record, as most of you know, is 250,000 pages long. This process took over 7 years. There were more than 12, more than a dozen site visits from the Army Corps. It involved 35 meetings with the Army Corps, 37 public comment letters, and I can go on, but the statistics are stark. And after a critical review of this and going back to the initial question, did the court come to rational permitting decision? We think that there is no doubt that on the merits, the answer to that question is yes. Finally, just as a note, specific to your question, we recently did submit 3 applications, Ona, the DeSoto mine and our Wingate extension, and so those currently are in process with the Army Corps.""]",question_answer,MOS_32114

He will also provide an update on South Fort Meade and the Cargill split-off transaction. Then Jim will share his views on the markets and Mosaic's strategic priorities. The presentation slides we are using during the call today are available on our website at mosaicco.com."", ""Recently, Mosaic was recognized for the second year in a row in the Corporate Responsibility Magazine 12th annual 100 Best Corporate Citizens List. This list is known as the world's top corporate responsibility ranking based on publicly available information. This recognition was due in part to our conservation and environmental stewardship, as well as our financial and governance transparency."", 'I also wanted to bring to your attention to one matter in our press release related to enhanced disclosure regarding MOP selling prices. We have included our average MOP crop nutrient selling prices for both North American and international customers in addition to the average MOP selling price. Historical information for the prior 14 quarters is included in our segment data table found on our website.', ""We will be making forward-looking statements during this conference call.

3943,Lawrence Stranghoener,"[""Thank you, Christine. Good morning, all. As many of you know, this is Christine's last earnings call, and I'm sure she'll miss them. Christine has led our IR function now for more than the three years she was originally asked to serve and will be rotating soon to a new role. Christine significantly enhanced our IR program, and we are grateful for her contributions. Joining us as our new Vice President of Investor Relations is Laura Gagnon. Laura brings a wealth of IR and related experience to us most recently at Ameriprise where she established the IR function following that company's spin-off from American Express."", ""Now let's turn to Slide 5. The long-term fundamentals for our business are outstanding, and we are effectively executing against our strategic priorities, which are aligned with this outlook. Yesterday, we reported record third quarter earnings with strong results in both of our business segments. As the leading producer of Potash and Phosphate, there is no company better positioned than Mosaic to capture the growth in crop nutrient markets."", 'Now let me highlight our financial results. As you can see on the slide, net earnings were $542 million or $1.21 per share compared to $222 million or $0.50 per share a year ago. We generated $366 million in operating cash flow this quarter and funded $312 million in capital expenditures, with the bulk of this going toward our Potash expansions. Gross margin was a record for any quarter at 39%, driven by outstanding market fundamentals and effective execution.', 'Our Phosphate business segment had an exceptional quarter. As summarized on Slide 6, we generated $372 million in operating earnings compared to $53 million a year ago. Gross margin improved to 31%, up from 11% a year ago and 24% last quarter. The improvement in third quarter operating earnings was primarily due to significantly higher selling prices, partially offset by higher raw material costs. Our focus on operational excellence contributed to our outstanding performance, particularly in mining. Mining production exceeded tonnage in the year-ago quarter by 10% due to better mining performance this quarter and the impact of mining curtailments in the year-ago quarter.', 'Our Potash segment also showed strong results in the third quarter. Potash operating earnings were $414 million, up about $90 million from last year as highlighted on Slide 7. This improvement was primarily due to the favorable effect of higher production volumes, increased selling prices and insurance recoveries. Compared to the second quarter, operating earnings, excluding discrete items, improved 49% as we began to realize MOP price increases announced last fall. Even though we continue to run our Potash mines at high rates to meet healthy demand, our Potash inventories remain low and are expected to remain so through the summer when we perform our usual turnarounds.', 'There were a couple of specific items to mention this quarter. Other operating income includes about $40 million or $0.07 per share for insurance recoveries, primarily in the Potash segment. And as previously announced, we redeemed $455 million aggregate principal amount of our 2014 senior notes. We recorded non-operating expense of $19 million or $0.03 per share in connection with this redemption. This was an opportunistic use of cash offering significant interest savings.', 'Now let me shift to financial guidance as summarized on Slide 8. We expect to finish this fiscal year on a strong note. For our fourth quarter, we estimate total Phosphate sales volumes of 2.5 million to 2.9 million tonnes. We expect an average DAP selling price in the fourth quarter of $560 to $590 per tonne. To meet continued high demand, we expect to operate our North American Phosphate plants in excess of 85% of granulation capacity. Tight market conditions for raw materials will likely pressure fourth quarter Phosphate gross margin compared to the third quarter. We have included a sensitivities chart in the appendix to our slide presentation that you might find helpful, particularly as it relates to sulfur and ammonia cost movements.', 'We expect continued improvement in our Potash segment due to strong demand and tight supply. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2011, we estimate total Potash sales volumes of 1.9 million to 2.2 million tonnes and an average MOP selling price of $385 to $415 per tonne. Note that we have sold the majority of our Potash for the North American spring season. We expect to run our Potash mines for the fourth quarter in excess of 90% of operating capacity. There are no changes to our financial guidance on capital expenditures, resource taxes, SG&A or our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011. We are making great progress on our Potash expansions with the first tonnes available from these expansions in 2012. Our projects generally are on time, on scope and on budget.', 'Now let me provide you with a brief update on the situation at our South Fort Meade mine. As many of you know, last July, we appealed the issuance of a preliminary injunction related to this mine. Writs have long been filed and oral arguments are scheduled for next week with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Our assessment remains the same. We believe this permit was exhaustively reviewed and validly issued by the Army Corps of Engineers. In the meantime, we have maintained our finished phosphate production at optimal levels since last summer as a result of our successful mitigating actions. These actions include exceptional mining performance at our other mines, a partial settlement in the South Fort Meade litigation, drawing down existing rock inventories, sourcing rock from our Miski Mayo joint venture and as needed, supplementing purchases of phosphate rock from third parties.', ""We continue to evaluate mining alternatives beyond this fiscal year, consistent with the District Court's order and the law. Depending on how long it takes to hear from the 11th Circuit, this may include mining in certain upland-only areas of our South Fort Meade tracts. In the interim, we may see a slightly higher average phosphate rock cost. Our operations at South Fort Meade together with other mitigation efforts are not expected to have a material impact on Mosaic's finished phosphate production through calendar 2011. We will continue to provide updates on South Fort Meade as may be warranted in the future."", ""Before we hear from Jim, let me finish with an update on the Cargill split-off transaction. In January, we announced an agreement to distribute Cargill's approximate 64% stake in Mosaic to Cargill's stockholders and debt holders in a complex transaction. Details are available in our SEC filings, and you should feel free to call us with any questions."", 'We are working through SEC comments related to the draft proxy and registration statement filings. Once completed and effective, we will issue the proxy statement and hold a special shareholder meeting to take a vote on the transaction. We expect to hold this meeting in the second calendar quarter depending upon completion of the SEC review process. Assuming shareholder approval in this time frame, the transaction closing and initial offering of shares should also occur in the second calendar quarter.', ""As you have heard from us before, we are excited about becoming a fully independent company. Though this transaction has no material impact on Mosaic's operations, we expect it will allow us additional strategic and financial flexibility. Our public float will also increase, making our stock eligible for the S&P 500 Index and allow us to control our own destiny as one of the world's preeminent crop nutrition companies without the inherent complexities of having a majority stockholder. With the balance sheet that we have built during the last several years, we are well positioned to deliver value to our shareholders in the years ahead."", ""With that, I'll turn the call over to Jim.""]",management_discussion,MOS_30878
3944,James Prokopanko,"[""Thanks, Larry. This has been another great quarter, and I'm proud and grateful for all that the Mosaic team has accomplished. Before we take your questions, I'd like to provide an overview of some of the factors we are watching that could potentially impact the crop nutrient markets. I will then finish with a recap of our strategic priorities."", 'We are watching the number of items as listed on Slide 10. The first key item we are watching is agricultural commodity markets. Outstanding underlying industry fundamentals remain intact despite recent political unrest and the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, which have roiled commodity markets. Farmers need to plant record acreage and reap ever-increasing yields in order to meet accelerating demand for grains and oilseeds. Grain and oilseed stock-to-use ratios are low, and commodity prices are hypersensitive to weather and demand developments.', 'Corn looks especially tight with less than two months of use estimated for the end of this crop year. This is the second lowest stock-to-use ratio since the early 1970s. The stock-to-use ratio was even lower if you exclude large strategic reserves held by China and India. Adding additional volatility to corn prices is speculation about the potential for large Chinese grain imports. With U.S. corn inventories at an all-time low, we need two years of bumper crops to move to more secure stock levels.', 'Weather continues to be a significant factor to watch. During this past year, extreme weather conditions have affected global grain and oilseed production. While we look forward to the North American spring season, we are mindful of potential weather delays such as wet field conditions. Wet fields may result in a late spring planting and could create logistics challenges for positioning crop nutrients.', ""Another key factor we are watching is supply uncertainty. In Phosphates, questions around the delay of the modern start up in Saudi Arabia, raw material uncertainty, changes in China's export duties, political unrest in North Africa and market concerns about permit litigation at our South Fort Meade mine have all contributed to tight market conditions."", 'In Potash, supply is tight as well. Increased supplies will be met with brownfield capacity additions. Our large Potash projects will play a significant role in meeting this demand. We believe brownfield projects currently underway are sufficient to supply robust demand growth over the course of this decade.', 'To some, the environment today may appear to be a repeat of the 2008 period. While we see some similarities, there are differences. While raw material supplies today are tight, we do not anticipate prices climbing to 2008 peak levels. In 2008, the supply chain pipeline was full. Today, that pipeline chain is lean. Dealers and farmers exhibit much more caution in their buying behavior today than they did in 2008.', 'As you can see in the chart on Slide 11, during the last cycle, the cost of crop nutrients relative to grain prices reached historically high levels. Now the relative cost is well within historic norms. Collectively, these factors paint a different and more sustainable picture than in 2008.', ""As can be seen in our results, successful execution of our strategic priorities is paying off. Mosaic's ability to supply the world's agricultural markets with a global scale, balanced portfolio of two vital crop nutrients is unparalleled in the industry. Mosaic's leadership in both Potash and Phosphates differentiates us from our peers, and the combination of these two strong businesses will continue to provide advantages in the years ahead."", 'Through the volatility of the markets we serve, we have created long-term value. Solid cash flow has allowed us to build one of the strongest balance sheets in the industry. We have demonstrated our willingness and ability to make investments, to divest non-strategic assets and to return cash to shareholders as appropriate.', ""The Cargill transaction is expecting us, to allow us to utilize our balance sheet more aggressively over time. Our strong cash position and significant mineral reserves give us the flexibility to continue our substantial investment in Mosaic's future growth. This fiscal year, we will spend over $700 million on our Potash expansions. Potash demand is growing, and we will add up to 5 million tonnes of capacity over the next decade to meet this demand."", 'Including reversion of the tolling agreement in Esterhazy, once complete, our peaking capacity will be nearly 17 million tonnes. In the future, we expect the higher sales volume from our Potash business to favorably contribute to a profitability and company valuation. Our expansions will ensure we continue to be one of the largest Potash companies in the world.', 'Our Phosphates business is producing exceptional results due to favorable market conditions and our focus on operational excellence. In fact, our year-to-date Phosphate operating profit exceeds our Potash operating profit. Mosaic is one of the lowest cost producers in the world, and we intend to maintain this advantage. We are reengineering processes, improving efficiencies and addressing supply chain opportunities.', ""Several other strategic priorities of our Phosphates segment are paying off. The realignment of our worldwide distribution and North American production assets a year ago is producing great results. No one can come close to Mosaic's scale or reach in global distribution. Our strategic investment in the Miski Mayo joint venture highlights our extensive resources and demonstrates our global scale and flexibility. Another highlight of our Phosphates segment is MicroEssentials. This premium product creates value for the farmer, for the dealer and for Mosaic. We are currently on pace to sell over 1 million tonnes of this product this fiscal year. And with growing demand, we are converting existing phosphate capacity for up to 2 million tonnes of MicroEssentials production annually."", 'Phosphate and Potash demand is strong. It is fully recovered from the decline of 2009 and is back on a solid growth path. We are forecasting Phosphate and Potash shipments to grow to record levels this year. We and other producers are running our mines and plants hard to keep up with this demand.', ""In closing, we're proud to be a leader in agriculture at a time when people around the world understand the importance of this industry and its attractive investment potential. We believe the crop nutrients sector provides the most direct exposure to favorable agricultural dynamics. Phosphate and Potash demand prospects are robust, driven by the need for farmers to plant record acreage and reap ever-increasing yields to meet accelerating grain and oilseed demand. Crop nutrients are essential to achieve needed productivity gains, and we are among the premier companies in this industry. By executing our cost-effective brownfield Potash expansions and strengthening our leading Phosphate position, we are creating shareholder value and delivering on our mission of helping the world grow the food it needs."", 'Back to you, Christine.']",management_discussion,MOS_30878

But we've seen some new projects, K+S buying Potash One and talking about building a solution mine in Saskatchewan, BHP perhaps going ahead and then EuroChem appears to be proceeding as well. So what would be your view of Potash pricing if some of these greenfield operations were to start up, recognizing that they'll take us several years to get underway?""]",question_answer,MOS_30878
3957,James Prokopanko,"[""Well, now there's a lot of interest, a bit of a gold rush to the Potash fields in Saskatchewan and other places in the world. Our view is unchanged. Brownfield is by far the most economic way at present to go forward. Brownfields in our case requires something in the range of $300 a tonne to generate the kind of returns we're looking for, and the greenfield is going to be double that. And so the economic wisdom of starting up a greenfield in this decade just is beyond my thinking. You are going to need $600 to justify that investment, and with the brownfields that are on the drawing board now, a greenfield, perhaps a solution mine in South America, that will take care of the demand growth for this decade. I can't explain what's going to justify somebody else going forward, but it's going to take the $600. And it's going to take, as you pointed out, considerable period of time to get a new mine up and operating. Our estimate is at least five years. Include all the infrastructure, permitting and all that goes with it, it could be as long as seven years. So that will get us into that just about the next decade.

So now that those have been pretty much put to bed, and I'll say the PhosChem contract was for April through September period, 1 million tonnes, so what can we conclude is that I think the world's looking at and ourselves as a supplier looking at shorter contract periods with a stronger markets that we're seeing. And I don't know that you can conclude anything basis on pricing from what's happened on Phosphate. You'd have to look at the Potash marketplace, and the most recent indicator is a deal that was published and announced in Brazil, where some Russian, Belarusian producers have made a sale, I think it was 520 CFR. So you're seeing the Potash market continue to firm. There's been a question I'll ask it before it's asked or answer it before it's asked, what's happening with the spread between domestic and international pricing on Potash? And with this 520, that's approximately $50 increase in reduction in the spread between domestic and North American and international prices. So I see it strengthening market. I see it’s likely shorter time periods, and attention I expect will now turn by -- the Indians will turn their attention to Potash now that they have phosphate and some nitrogen purchased.""]",question_answer,MOS_30878

And first is, what would actually be the maximum rate that you could run your mines versus the north of 85% and north of 90% that you guys see for next quarter? And second, is the fact that you're not running Phosphate more aggressively a reflection of perhaps some bottlenecks in your rock supply or a view that you would like to forgo some less profitable sales, just curious why you're not maxing that out given the robust global demand backdrop you talked about.""]",question_answer,MOS_30878
3967,James Prokopanko,"[""Lindsay, it's Jim here. We look at maximum operating rates at pretty much at a 90% of nameplate capacity. We have turnarounds and this is pretty much a standard in the industry, of turnarounds in Potash. You can have a mine and a mill down for as long as a month. You have unexpected outages and days lost here and there through a variety of things, power interruptions and so on. So 90% is effectively 100%, and we may have the days or weeks where you're running at 92%, 93%, but we expect that the average for the year is, with things running very well, is at 90%. And we're approaching those numbers now. Why haven't we been hitting 90% all the way through? It's been a matter of ramping up to those kind of levels. This market has really come alive in the last four months where the pipeline has really been opened to recharging and filling the warehouses.

4010,Larry Stranghoener,"['Thank you Christine and happy new year everyone.  It’s a great time to be the world’s leading producer of phosphate and potash.  We are on track for an outstanding year in fiscal 2011.  Our second quarter results reflect strong global phosphate and potash demand.  We had a great North American fall application season with demand outstripping production and we see a continuation of this trend in coming months.', 'We are executing against our strategic plans and delivering results.  As you can see on Slide 3, this quarter we earned net income of $1 billion or $2.29 per share compared to 24 cents a year ago.  This includes an after-tax gain of $570 million or $1.28 per share on the sale of our interest in Fosfertil.  The gross proceeds from this sale were $1 billion.  In addition, we generated $532 million in operating cash flow this quarter and funded $291 million of capital expenditures with the bulk of this going toward our potash expansions.', 'We also recently announced the redemption of the remaining $455 million aggregate principal amount of our 2014 senior notes.  This transaction will close next week and was an opportunistic use of cash that offers significant interest savings.  Our phosphates business segment had an exceptional quarter compared to both the year ago period as well as the first quarter of this year.  As summarized on Slide 4, both sales volumes and the averaged realized DAP price exceeded the high end of our guidance ranges.', 'We generated $402 million in operating earnings compared to $29 million a year ago.  Over the first half of this fiscal year our phosphate segment operating earnings have outpaced potash earnings.  The improvement in second quarter operating earnings compared to last year was primarily due to significantly higher selling prices and record sales volumes partially offset by higher sulfur and ammonia costs.  Our phosphate segment generated a gross margin of 24% driven by strong sales volumes in North America and above average margins on blend products.', 'Demand was strong in many markets during the quarter though we chose to sell more into North America, which contributed to a record level of shipments.  This robust demand has drawn down phosphate finished goods inventories to record low levels in spite of high operating rates at our concentrate plants.  While phosphate rock production was impacted by the temporary closure of our South Fort Meade mine, finished goods production has not been impacted and we expect to keep our concentrates plants running near capacity to meet expected North American spring demand.', 'Our potash segment had a boost from the strong North American fall application season.  Potash operating earnings were $252 million this quarter, up 67% compared to last year as highlighted on Slide 5.  This improvement was primarily due to significantly improved sales volumes and the favorable effect of higher production rates partially offset by a decline in selling prices and an increase in Canadian resources taxes and royalties.  Compared to the first quarter operating earnings improved 15% even though MLP production and cost per ton performance in the quarter were constrained by turn arounds that were postponed from the summer.', 'We ramped up potash production during the course of the quarter and are now operating at very high rates.  We are producing as much product as we can to meet continued healthy demand.  Potash inventories are relatively low by historical standards and are expected to remain so.  The hearty appetites of India, China and North America should drive higher shipments during the second half of our fiscal year.  Now let me shift to financial guidance as summarized on Slide 6.', 'We begin calendar 2011 expecting record phosphate and potash shipments against the backdrop of low producer and distribution pipeline inventories.  Being a major producer of both phosphate and potash positions us well in this environment.  For our third quarter we estimate total phosphate sales volumes of 2.4 to 2.7 million tons.  Third quarter sales volumes will be impacted by normal seasonal factors following which we expect a very good fourth quarter led by strong North American spring demand.', 'We expect an average DAP selling price in the third quarter of $510-540 per ton as we capture the upward momentum in DAP pricing.  To meet continued high demand and build finished goods inventory we expect to operate our North American phosphate plants in excess of 85% of granulation capacity in our third quarter.  For raw materials we expect slightly higher sulfur and ammonia costs in the third quarter compared with second quarter levels.  We have included a sensitivities chart in the appendix to our slide presentation that you might find helpful particularly as it relates to sulfur and ammonia cost movements.', 'Now shifting to potash, MLP market pricing and volume continues to firm.  For the third quarter of fiscal 2011 we estimate total potash sales volumes of 1.9 to 2.1 million tons and an average MLP selling price of $330-350 per ton.  Domestic MLP prices continue to increase while export pricing has lagged primarily because of certain fixed price contracts established a year ago.  Recent MLP price increases into Brazil and North America should be realized beginning in our fourth fiscal quarter.  We expect to run our potash mines for the third quarter in excess of 90% of operating capacity which should lead to improved per ton production costs compared to the second quarter.', 'We are funding capital projects that improve efficiencies in both our potash and phosphate segments and are making great progress on our potash expansion plans.  Because we have moved some potash sustaining projects into fiscal 2012 we are revising capital spending guidance downward by $200 million.  We now expect capital spending for fiscal 2011 to range from $1.2-1.4 billion.  Due to improved profitability in our potash segment we are also revising our guidance for Canadian resource taxes and royalties upward by $100 million to a $250-300 million range for fiscal 2011.', 'There are no changes to our annual guidance on SG&A and our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 that we previously provided and as shown on this slide.  With that, I’ll turn the call over to Jim.']",management_discussion,MOS_29693
4011,Jim Prokopanko,"['Thanks Larry.  This has been a great quarter and I’m proud of what the Mosaic team has accomplished.  Before we turn the call over to Q&A I would like to review our strategic priorities and provide a brief market outlook.  First, we have been executing well against our potash expansion plans as detailed on Slide 8.  We are well on our way to adding 5 million tons of additional capacity through this decade.', 'So far we have committed over $3 billion to bring on an additional 3 million tons of capacity over the next several years with an additional 2 million tons in early planning stages.  These projects include the expansion of mining and milling capacity at all three Canadian mine sites.  Underground we are adding mining equipment and conveyers as well as further development of new mine cavities for our solution mine at Belle Plaine.', 'Above ground we are adding milling, screening, compaction and storage capacity.  Our biggest project is the construction of the K-3 shaft at Esterhazy.  Once completed we will have three distinct operating shafts at Esterhazy.  We are currently drilling the freeze holes and anticipate shaft sinking to start in calendar 2012.  These capacity expansions are significant undertakings but 1200 contractors, engineers and employees are dedicated to these projects.  We’re making great progress and are on time, on scope and on budget.', 'In addition to these expansion projects we also have capacity at our Esterhazy mine that is currently dedicated to production under a toiling agreement (so even at) current shipment levels we anticipate this will revert back to Mosaic by the middle of this calendar year and will add another 1.3 million tons of annual capacity at no additional capital cost.  As we bring on new capacity to meet increased potash demand over the coming years, we expect the higher sales volume from our potash business to favorably contribute to our profitability as well as to our company valuation.', 'Our expansions will ensure we continue to be one of the premier potash companies in the world.  Moving on to Slide 9, the variety of initiatives in our phosphate segment are allowing us to maintain our low cost position.  We have teams working on improving energy efficiency, optimizing maintenance, streamlining procurement and many other projects.  Collectively we are generating efficiencies and cost savings and we expect more to follow.  Another highlight of our phosphate segment is MicroEssentials, a premium product that incorporates sulfur and other micronutrients in each and every phosphate granule.', 'MicroEssentials is an innovative crop nutrition solution.  This patented product ensures uniform distribution of nutrients in each granule.  We have over 10 years of research trials demonstrating value for farmers through higher yields.  MicroEssentials earns a higher margin and has been a resounding success.  We are currently on pace to sell over 1 million tons this fiscal year and with growing demand we are finalizing capital investments that will convert existing phosphate capacity for up to 2 million tons of MicroEssentials annually.', 'This premium product is a win-win for the farmer, for the dealer and for Mosaic.  Finally, the realignment of our worldwide distribution and North American production assets continues to pay off.  The optimization of our production to feed our global distribution supply chain is working well and is reflected in our strong phosphate segment results this quarter.  Now I’ll provide an update on developments at South Fort Meade.', 'During our last earnings call we outlined a number of factors under consideration that were designed to keep our finished phosphate production running at near capacity until the South Fort Meade litigation is resolved.  As previously announced, we reached a partial settlement with the plaintiffs that will allow approximately four months of uplands mining in the Havarti County Extension.  We expect to mine approximately 900,000 tons of phosphate rock during this period, which began in early December.', 'In addition, we have been drawing down existing phosphate rock against finished goods inventories, optimizing mining at our Florida mines, sourcing phosphate rock from our Miski Mayo joint venture and as needed, supplementing with purchases from third parties.  During the quarter we began receiving rock from our Miski Mayo joint venture.  For our Louisiana operations imported rock has substantially replaced Florida produced rock.  We will continue to pursue these mitigation strategies as long as is needed.', 'As many of you know, we have appealed the issuance of the preliminary injunction that has made it necessary to take these mitigating actions.  The 11th Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled oral arguments for the first week of April, 2011.  Our assessment remains the same.  We believe that the permit was exhaustively reviewed and validly issued by the Army Corps of Engineers and we look forward to presenting our case.  South Fort Meade remains one of our highest priorities.', 'We continue to evaluate ways to keep the mine operating until the appellate court rules.  While mitigating strategies have been successful to date, we are determined to regain full access to this mine.  Our South Fort Meade mine is one of the most cost effective and efficient operations in the world and we fully expect that we will be able to mine the ample resources located at South Fort Meade in the years ahead.', 'Now let me finish with a brief overview of the market outlook, which looks good from any angle that we can see.  Phosphate and potash demand is booming.  It has not just recovered from the decline in 2009 but it is back on a solid growth trajectory.  We are forecasting phosphates and potash to grow to record levels this year.  This upbeat outlook is underpinned by a number of factors as listed on Slide 12.  Global grain and oil seed demands continue to accelerate.  This implies strong growth in global crop nutrient markets.', 'These factors combined with lower producer stocks have led to extraordinarily high prices for a wide variety of agricultural commodities.  This translates into exceptionally profitable farm economics worldwide.  Markets are sending clear signals to farmers around the globe to seed more area and apply more crop nutrients.  In the United States we expect a real contest for acreage this spring.  Our analysis indicates that markets will need to bid for 92-93 million acres of corn and 77-78 million acres of soybeans.', 'US acreage and crop nutrient demand in 2010-2011 is expected to rival the high levels of 2006-2007.  The fall application season was outstanding and P and K shipments this spring are expected to exceed the five-year average and the totals last fall.  High agricultural commodity prices are not the only reason for the upbeat outlook.  Producers are beginning this year with low inventories following blockbuster shipments during the past six months.  Global distribution pipeline inventories remain at low levels in most regions.', 'And several supply uncertainties still overhang the phosphate market.  Around the world we continue to see a focus on food security.  I visited with several customers in India last month and I can tell you first hand that the 50% growth in DAK sales and the 40% increase in potash sales during the last three years is evident in the countryside.  Grain and oil seed demand and consumption is growing and no one wants to be caught short of crop nutrients.', 'In Brazil for the first time that I can recall vessels loaded with crop nutrients were given priority to discharge in order to get sufficient tonnage in place prior to the recent planting season.  We project that Brazilian crop nutrient shipments of 26 million tons in 2011 will eclipse the previous record set in 2007.  On balance the outlook for Mosaic is remarkable and we are excited about the future of our business.  It’s a great time to be the world’s leading producer of phosphate and potash.  We are executing well against our long-term strategy to create shareholder value and for fulfilling our mission to help the world grow the food it needs.

That’s tough work to get that all working quickly so I think it’s going to be if it’s not late 2011, it’ll be up and operating 2012.  It’s close to 3 million ton production capacity.  I think that’s going to probably take if it works well, it would be up and fully operating at 18 months, probably closer to 24 months.  So it’s going to be a slow ramp up in production.', 'All the while and I touched on it to the question of OCP - we have a phosphate market that is growing 2-1/2 to 3 million tons a year.  That’s on the top side.  That’s 1-1/2 million more tons a year.  So the modern project is two years of growth.

We definitely have seen potash prices strengthen in North America going into spring.

So it’s going to take some time to fill the gap and it always ebbs and flows and we expect that during this calendar year we’ll see that gap close.

To the question of Janssen, I think we’re in a situation that our view is a brown field.', 'In our case it’s a brown field expansion to $5 billion.  If we’re - that’s going to require something in the $300 a ton or maybe a bit less than that to justify the kind of cost of capital ROI.  You get into the new build green field, we think it’s double that that you’d need.  You’d need something closer to $600 a ton.

4059,Larry Stranghoener,['Yeah Mark.  It comes from the equity income line.

4061,Jeff Zekauskas,"['Hi.  Thanks for taking my question.  It looks like your North American tonnage in phosphate will be very, very strong this year.  Call it - I don’t know - 3-1/2 million tons, something like that.  And when you look back often your tonnage is more in the mid 2’s or the high 2’s.  So do you think this is a year of over application of phosphate because of the high grain prices and that probably in 2012 or 2013 you’ll have lower DAP applications in North America?  Or do you see it differently?']",management_discussion,MOS_29693
4062,Jim Prokopanko,"['Hi.  Good morning Jeff.  I don’t think there is over application.  I think we’ve had a couple years now that and reports from soil tests and accumulation of data from the field in the US has indicated that there has been a draw down of phosphate levels in US farm soils.  And the high yields that we have had the last couple of years would support that.  Our calculations show that more corn has been - more phosphate has been removed from the fields in terms of in corn and soybeans than has been applied.', 'So we think there is to the contrary, some catch up that is necessary and I think back to closer to normal kinds of levels.  And we have good indications supporting that this fall, just outstanding farm applications and we are getting signals that this spring will be just as strong.  Rick, why don’t you add some dimension to that?']",management_discussion,MOS_29693
4063,Rick McLellan,"['Yeah.  Thanks Jim.  Hi Jeff.  I think what we’re hearing from dealers in North America that application rates were strong but not anything extra.  And maybe what you’re seeing is the impact of North American buyers didn’t come as early to buy and waited for phosphates.  And it’s caused some phosphates to be shipped out of this - more phosphates to be shipped out of the country during the period that normally would have filled North America.', 'And so I think there are no major swings other than an increase in use in phosphates.  But nothing that we’re going to see fall away next year.']",management_discussion,MOS_29693

4066,Fai Lee,"['Great.  Thanks.  Jim, I just have a question regarding phosphate in your global demand growth.  You expect demand to continue to grow going forward and I guess production will also increase.  Do you think the sulfur market in terms of sulfur production will be able to keep up with the growth in phosphate demand?']",management_discussion,MOS_29693
4067,Jim Prokopanko,"['Fai, first I’m going to just correct something that I just looked at some notes.  I think I said to another question that we’re going to see 2-1/2 to 3% annual growth.  Our formal global demand forecast is 2 to 2-1/2% of phosphates so just to set that record straight.  The sulfur demand I think is going to be largely driven and has been by gasoline and oil refining, gasoline production and oil refining and diesel refining.', 'The plants have been running reasonably well, the refiners have been running reasonably well compared to some of the hiccups we saw 18 months and 24 months ago.  But with continued demand on sulfur or continued increasing demand for phosphates we’re going to see continued increasing demand in sulfur.  And I think that’s going to remain relatively tight.  China is running at pretty high rates.  They’re a big draw on world sulfur use.', 'We see on the other hand we get the tar sands in Canada.  If you get a little mid term and longer term tar sands in Canada get going again with these high oil prices and I think they will, we’ll start seeing increased sulfur production.  So some dislocations perhaps over the next 12 and 18 months but beyond that, low diesel emission standards that are coming in, we see sulfur supplies rebounding and meeting the needs of the phosphate producers.']",management_discussion,MOS_29693

And in particular, I know that’s gone into Saskatchewan court I believe.  But has there been a formal agreement between yourselves and the Potash Corp that kind of led you to estimate a mid calendar year 2011 date for the reversion?', 'And then from a marketing side should we assume that once that reversion takes place your Canpotex allocation will change as well?  In other words, will some marketing rights come along with the capacity at the same time?  Thanks.']",management_discussion,MOS_29693
4070,Jim Prokopanko,"['Okay David.  Two questions there - first is in regards to the agreement.  Well, we’re in Saskatchewan courts because we don’t have an agreement.  So our estimate of what is left owing to the toiling party is going to take us into some time in the summer.  And we will in that case be complete with what in our view is owed under the terms of the contract.  The other party interprets the contract differently and what it comes down to is amongst other things what the extraction rate over history has been, what the available reserves were for mining.', 'And so there are a number of technical matters that are in dispute and it’s just as simple as that.  You get two geologists in a room and you’re hardly going to have an agreement and so that’s where we’re at.  It’s just simply a matter of interpretation of the legal agreement and what some of the mining practices and our view is that it ends in mid-2011.  They have a different outlook.  And we’ll get this resolved in due course.  As far as the Canpotex, our interpretation is that when that mining capacity reverts back to its owner Mosaic, that those marketing rights should come with that.  And that’s simply our position on it David.']",management_discussion,MOS_29693
