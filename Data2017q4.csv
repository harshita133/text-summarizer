2,2659,Chuck Magro,"[""Thanks, Richard. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our first earnings call as Nutrien. Today we will recap the fourth quarter and the full year performance of our legacy companies and provide insight into how we see the market unfolding in 2018. I would also like to share my thoughts on the strategic priorities for Nutrien, our financial guidance for the year and additional details on our synergy targets.I'm excited for the future of Nutrien. I believe we have a tremendous opportunity ahead of us and our goal is to ensure we deliver on those opportunities and exceed the expectations of all of our stakeholders.First, let's talk about our legacy company's results and Nutrient pro forma. The strength of our global Retail business was evident again this quarter. We achieved record Retail EBITDA, driven by strong sales and higher margins across our entire portfolio of crop inputs and services.For the full year, Retail EBITDA rose to $1.2 billion, an 8% increase over the previous year. This growth was supported by higher proprietary product sales, a continued focus on operational excellence initiatives and contributions from acquisitions. As a result, we delivered further improvement on all Retail operational metrics in 2017. For example, our cash operating coverage ratio declined to 60% and our EBITDA to sales ratio increased to 10%, while our normalized comparable store sales increased by 2%. As such, the majority of our Retail targets set for 2020 have now been met or exceeded.It's worth highlighting that our Australian Retail operations achieved record EBITDA of $154 million this year, up 26% over last year and more than double the EBITDA in 2012. Our EBITDA margins for Landmark reached 8.8% this year compared with just 3.6% in 2012.Fourth quarter performance for the legacy Agrium wholesale business benefited from strong potash results, but was impacted by lower production and sales volumes in both nitrogen and phosphate. Overall, Agrium generated $1.6 billion in cash from operations during the fourth quarter and $1.3 billion for the year, supported by our integrated business structure. And this is a testament of our operating model strength.Turning to the legacy PotashCorp results. The fourth quarter continued the trend of improved year-over-year performance for the Potash business due to higher realized potash prices and lower cost. For the full year, PotashCorp benefited from significantly improved global market conditions as our average realized potash price increased 11% and sales volumes rose by 8%, and importantly, our cash cost per tonne declined by 13% in 2017, a direct result of portfolio optimization decisions taken over the past 2 years.This included the ramp-up of our expanded Rocanville potash mine, the largest and one of the lowest cost mines in the world. Cash cost for this mine were around $50 per tonne in 2017 based on production of nearly 5 million tonnes.Nitrogen margins during the fourth quarter were supported by improved market conditions and an increase in global benchmark prices for both ammonia and urea.Phosphate results for the quarter were impacted by non-cash impairment charges totaling $276 million at our White Springs and feed phosphate facilities.PotashCorp's adjusted earnings totaled $59 million for the quarter and $455 million for the year and were supported by improved Potash segment results. Cash from operating activities totaled $1.2 billion for the year, which was in line with last year.Nutrien will release pro forma historical financial information later this month, but to give you a high level sense for performance this year, our adjusted combined EBITDA totaled approximately $2.9 billion and combined cash flow from operating activities was $2.5 billion. This was achieved in a year that we believe represents a relative low point in the crop nutrient cycle and does not include the $0.5 billion in future merger synergies.With more than 25 million tonnes of primary crop nutrient sales, Nutrien is well positioned to benefit from the recovery in the fertilizer markets in the next couple of years.In terms of the contribution by business segment, Retail accounted for 36% of the total EBITDA, with Potash contributing 33%, Nitrogen around 1/4 and Phosphate the reminder. All together we invested $1 billion in sustaining capital to maintain our assets, which still provided significant free cash flow to return to shareholders and continued to grow our Retail business.Before I speak about our 2018 guidance and strategic priorities, I would like to touch on the outlook of our markets. The 2017-2018 crop year will mark yet another year of above trend yields for global grains and oilseed production. While this has contributed to more modest crop price environment, it has also supported significant growth in global consumption. In fact global demand has grown at an annualized rate of 2.7% over the past 5 years, which is the highest 5-year growth period since the early 1980s.In simple terms, this robust agricultural growth story has translated into greater demand for crop inputs, services and solutions. For the upcoming North American planting season, we expect relatively stable acreage of most major crops and application rates of crop input similar to last year. This should be supported by North American grower crop margins, which are above last year's levels.Our Retail business has collected grower prepay of over $1.5 billion, which is in line with last year and an indication of solid anticipated spend this spring. We anticipate the crop protection product market to be firm this year, with price appreciation for some products such as glyphosates and generic products, which is partially associated with higher production cost in China.The feed market is expected to remain flat in 2018 as price appreciation on technologies is expected to offset some competitive price pressure due to relatively low crop prices.In potash, we are seeing strong customer engagement and steady to higher prices to begin 2018. Global potash shipments set a new record of approximately 64 million tonnes in 2017, which was driven by strong consumption growth in all major offshore markets. Potash remains highly affordable, and with relatively low inventories across the supply chain, we forecast global potash shipments between 64 and 66 million tonnes in 2018.Canpotex had a record year in 2017 and is actively filling its order book as the growing season approaches in several key agricultural regions. We had a positive response to our domestic winter fill program announced in early January and are fully committed through the first quarter with orders taken at prices up $20 per tonnes for the second quarter deliveries.We expect new greenfield potash capacity will enter the market this year, but anticipate the amount of actual supply in 2018 will be limited by typical ramp-up issues, as well as announced mine closures and product mix changes by some producers. Therefore, we see a relatively favorable environment for potash well into 2018 as supported by the recent price increases in several markets.Turning to Nitrogen, prices remain firm in the early part of 2018, with benchmark prices up between 15% to 40% from the fourth quarter 2017. Chinese production rates have been cut back by ongoing regulatory pressure that includes reduced natural gas availability, significantly higher natural gas prices and continued strength in coal. We view these changes as a more structural shift and anticipate lower exports from Chinese urea producers moving forward.North American nitrogen demand is expected to be relatively stable in 2018 and the ongoing ramp-up of new domestic capacity will further reduce dependence on offshore imports. However, due to the slow pace of imports and large offshore exports over the past 6 months, we expect relatively tight supply in North America between now and the spring application season.Overall, we anticipate an improved nitrogen market compared to 2017 based on the expectations for higher global energy prices, lower Chinese exports and demand growth absorbing recent capacity additions.We expect higher sales volumes for potash in 2018 compared to our 2017 combined total. This is in line with the anticipated growth in global potash demand. We also expect our total nitrogen sales volume to be higher in 2018, which is partially due to higher on-stream time for our plants in North America and Trinidad. Our Trinidad operating rate is expected to be higher in 2018 due to improved gas availability.Based on these market conditions, we announced annual earnings guidance of $2.10 to $2.60 per share in 2018. This excludes incremental depreciation related to purchase price allocation adjustments, share-based payment expenses and synergy implementation cost.The EPS guidance includes equity earnings from SQM and APC for a portion of 2018, but is excluded in the EBITDA guidance. We also provide EBITDA guidance of $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion for 2018.Let's now move on to Nutrien strategic priorities. Over the past months, I've had the opportunity to visit our offices and operating sites and I've been very impressed with the quality of assets in the Nutrien portfolio and the depth of talent within the organization.With this strong foundation in place, the management team and the board will be focused on a few key strategic areas over the next 6 to 12 months. First and foremost, our priority will be delivering our integration plan, which includes capturing $0.5 billion in synergies by the end of 2019.While we are only a month into the process as Nutrien, I can tell you that the extensive work completed over the course of 2017 has allowed us to hit the ground running. Integration teams are in place and each business unit is working towards its synergy plan.In the early stages, we will be focused on capturing synergies in the areas such as procurement, transportation and distribution, operations and finance. In fact over the first month, we've already captured $40 million in run rate synergies and have identified a number of opportunities that reinforces our confidence to deliver on our synergies target. Starting in the first quarter, we will report detailed synergies on a quarterly basis.The second priority is to define strategic areas of focus for each business unit, including a portfolio review of our assets within the first 12 months and the completion of required equity divestment.Many of you will have seen the announcement in January on the divestiture of our 14% stake in ICL. We were very pleased with this outcome, and just to clarify, we received net proceeds of $685 million. We continue to make good progress on the divestiture of the SQM and APC stakes, and based on current market values, we believe the sale of these 3 equity stakes could generate proceeds after tax of between $4.5 billion and $5 billion.We recently announced the acquisition of Agrichem in Brazil and I'm excited about the opportunity in this major growing region of the world. As a leader in Brazilian specialty nutrient market, the Agrichem team and extensive product profile will be an excellent fit with our Loveland products business.Brazil will be a strategic focus for future retail expansion due to its large and growing agricultural retail and crop input market. We will also continue to focus on growing our footprint through tuck-in acquisitions in our existing regions, particularly in North America, and as such, we acquired 44 locations this past year with approximately $300 million in annual synergies and an average EBITDA multiple of just over 7x before synergies.Furthermore, we continue to pursue greenfield location builds in 7 US states. In 2017, 2 locations became operational and we expect construction will be completed on another 6 locations in 2018.Finally, it is a top priority to establish a clear capital allocation policy. Our goal is to maximize shareholder value and you can expect a balance between return of capital to shareholders and growth of the business, while maintaining a strong investment grade rating.We will be in a position to more clearly articulate our plans for returning cash to shareholders in the coming months, but I can tell you our priority will be to pay a stable and growing dividend. We will target a payout that would represent 40% to 60% of our free cash flow through the cycle. In line with previous disclosure, Nutrien's annual dividend is expected to be $1.57 per share, which is well within our targeted payout range and should also allow for future growth.To conclude, Nutrien's integrated business model and unique position within the agricultural landscape provides us with significant levers to create value for our shareholders.With a clear line of sight on $500 million of synergies and significant proceeds expected from the sale of our equity investment, we're coming out of the gate with a strong free cash flow position and a healthy balance sheet. As well the fundamentals for our business have improved and in particular the outlook for potash and nitrogen markets. This affords us with a lot of flexibility to allocate capital effectively and generate excellent shareholder returns.I'm joined today by members of the Nutrien executive leadership team and we would be happy to take your questions.

5,2662,Chuck Magro,"[""Yes, I'll give you a summary and then I'll have Wayne just talk a little bit about what he's seeing in his area, and maybe Raef Sully, our President of Potash, could talk about what we're doing in potash. But look, we've been at this for well over a year now, and when we look at it, the $500 million of annual synergies, we're very confident about that number. And for 2018, just to set the context, we're expecting $250 million on a run rate basis. And then if you will look at our annual guidance, the number that we expect to deliver for the full year is about $200 million. And in Q1, we've hit the ground running, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. We're over $40 million on a run rate basis. And we're starting to see areas such as leverage from some of our finance service providers, of course the network optimization when it comes to production specifically around our nitrogen optimization and our potash optimization and then very significant synergies in the supply chain. We're already down 200 railcars in our fleet, we're reducing our warehouse footprint quite rapidly and that's shedding a tremendous amount of cost. But I'll pass it over to Wayne just to talk about some of the procurement synergies and then I will have Raef Sully talk a little bit about potash.

6,2663,Wayne R. Brownlee,"[""Jacob, we are on track. We've already reached about $20 million in procurement synergies in the first month, which is a run rate for the course of the year. And we're optimistic that we will find quite a bit more over the course of the year and we'll be well in excess of $100 million by the time we're done, probably closer to $150 million.

7,2664,Raef M. Sully,"[""Jacob, one of the largest opportunity we have got of course is optimizing our production footprint. As you know, we have got 6 operating mines. There's quite a difference in the cost of production across those 6 mines and we're looking to move production to the lowest cost mines. As Chuck mentioned, Rocanville is down at around $50 dollars a tonne cash cost. We actually think there's probably more room to go on that. We're going to look at trying to ramp it past the 5, 4 mark. We'll head up towards 6 over the next couple of years. And we think that there's a fair bit more than the original $50 million we had tagged for that.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017

9,2666,Andrew Wong,"[""I have a couple of questions, first on the guidance. It looks like there might be some sort of disconnect in the EPS and the EBITDA outlook versus the consensus, and I think you touched on some of those things like the purchase price allocations and the equity and earnings. Could you just maybe help us walk through in more detail what's in the outlook and maybe what the outlook would look like if you included the equity earnings on a full year basis? And then just secondly, if you could provide us an update on the sale of your SQM and Arab Potash stakes?""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017
10,2667,Chuck Magro,"[""Look, let's start with the guidance and I'll give you our view on how we set the EBITDA guidance and what's in it and what's not importantly, and then I'll ask Wayne to talk a little bit about the EPS guidance, because that is being affected of course by some of the merger accounting. And then Wayne can also address your question on the equity stake. We provided EBITDA guidance because I think it's the best view for our recurring earnings for the core of the business. And of course that range we set now is $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion with a midpoint of $3.45 billion. And it's important to note that the equity stake, so the equity pickup in last year that was about $170 million, that is not included in the EBITDA guidance range. So that's really important to communicate clearly. And that's simply because we do intend to sell them because of the regulatory settlements that we made with the government. So that's the first set of adjustments that I think needs to be kind of observed. In all cases for guidance, though, we are assuming that retail growth is EBITDA. The other thing we're assuming in all of the guidance numbers that we have provided is that we deliver our synergies because we have strong confidence that we will hit our synergy target. So then when you look at the range, $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion, really the difference is all market price and it's really fundamental in terms of what the market price is for nitrogen and potash. And if I can just paint the book end for you. So at $3.2 billion of EBITDA, and that's the low end, retail grows, we deliver our synergies, but the market prices are basically where they were in 2017. Clearly, that's not where we are today. It's probably a bit conservative in my eye, but that's the one end of the book -- the guidance book end. The other end of the book end, $3.7 billion, we grow retail, we hit our synergies and the market prices are up somewhere between $30 and $40 a tonne. And if you look at that, that's the massive leverage that this new company has to the upside when it comes to market pricing. So then you look at the midpoint, $3.45 billion, retail grows, we deliver our synergies and you need market pricing to increase around $20 a tonne on nitrogen and potash versus last year. And that's up almost 20% than versus the 2.9 billion that the pro forma company delivered last year. So I'd say that's pretty significant operational improvements and growth. And the combination is retail growth, delivering our synergies and a little help from the market. Now, when you move to EPS, of course there's the merger accounting and I'll let Wayne explain that. And then Wayne can also address your question on the equity sales.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017
11,2668,Wayne R. Brownlee,"[""The big item that we are still working through is the purchase price accounting. As you know, the market value of -- since accounting-wise Agrium was the acquiree, the market value was $10 billion higher than the book value. So we have to adjust for that. We're going through a evaluation process right now that we expect to wrap up by close to the end of the first quarter. That range of additional amortization or depreciation could be somewhere in the range of $150 million to $300 million. So we need to sit on that and we'll come back and we'll give you pretty good directional guidance by the end of the first quarter. So that will be the biggest adjustment. It's of course a non-cash item. It's just purely accounting speak. And that will have the biggest impact on the earnings per share. As Chuck noted, the equity investments are not included in the EBITDA -- sorry, the equity investments are not included in the EBITDA. We fully expect to incur some income from them over the course of the year. They will show up as discontinued items in our financial statements going forward, but they would have otherwise normally have been in the EBITDA. So that adjusts for the difference. With regards to sales process, as you know, we concluded the Israel Chemicals sale in January. Still we're continuing to work through Arab Potash Company and SQM. We have a robust bidding process in both of those 2 entities. And it's speculative in some ways to try and determine when those -- the sale of those equity interest will take effect, because not only do we have to reach an agreement with a third party, but we will also have to probably go through any regulatory hurdles that may be required to close those sales. So we expect that to continue through this year. We're hoping that by the end of the second quarter we might be in a position on Arab Potash Company. That remains to be determined. And we'll continue to work through SQM. And once again, the timing of that will be determined, but the bidding process to-date on a very preliminary basis has been quite robust.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017

15,2672,Raef M. Sully,"[""So, look, Don, all of those things are on the table. We're certainly looking at those options at the minute. As I said, we were looking just at optimizing the plants we have running. You'll know that New Brunswick isn't producing at the moment. It's down. We took Cory down to white only recently. And prior to that, we had Allan and Lanigan taken down [indiscernible]. So I think in the short-term we need the 6 running.

16,2673,Chuck Magro,"[""Don, it's Chuck. So, look, when we look at the market for potash, certainly what we see right now is demand is quite robust in all global markets. And so if you look at our guidance that we provided, we're only going to take our sales book up about 3%. But there's a lot of optimization with the 3% that we can get significantly lower cost by moving product to the lower cost facilities and then trying to maximize sales from the higher premium potash business. And then there's this notion of the integration into retail with some of the higher premium products. So all that's underway. When we look at that, the synergy creation is quite substantial. And then we need to understand if the market continues to grow at 2.5% to 3% per year, what ultimate capacity are we going to have the need from our production? And those decisions are going to take a little bit more time for us. We're going to have to look at demand in the second half of the year as we move into 2019. But we're going to, rest assured, look at the best long-term optimization decisions for that business.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017

20,2677,Susan Jones,"[""Yes, our EBITDA range for the year is going to be between $150 million and $200 million for the Phosphate business. Fortunately, we have had global phosphate prices firm in the first quarter, so we're out of the gate with fairly robust demand and pull, which is nice to see. I did want to address your turnaround question. And first and foremost, we are very much focused on the synergy number. We have a target of $80 million in synergies that we have been discussing with shareholders since the time that we announced the merger. And in essence, this is replacing third-party rocks for our Redwater facility with excess capacity at our Aurora, North Carolina and White Springs, Florida facilities. Now, we are looking at 3 options to address this right now. One is moving rock to Redwater to upgrade its MAP. Another is moving acid to Redwater to upgrade its MAP. And finally, just moving finished MAP straight into Western Canada and looking to repurpose our Redwater facility. And of course in any of these scenarios, we're going to be looking to use the legacy PotashCorp's excess capacity and combining that with Agrium legacy's retail demand to create the synergies. So as part of this what is really key is we need to look at the capital to be spent to achieve the synergies. And it's looking right now with this, the least amount of capital is just to simply move the finished MAP. But that's the synergy plan that we're focused on and I am very confident we're going to be able to achieve those synergies. And we are of course going to have phosphate as part of the overall portfolio review. We're looking at the feed business. We're looking at the industrial business.

23,2680,Chuck Magro,"[""It's Chuck. I'll take your question. So, look, I think when we gave the guidance -- here's the backdrop. The demand is quite strong, especially in the first half. And some of the new capacity that's coming into the market, we don't believe will have saleable tonnes certainly in the first half of any big significance. The second half, we'll we need to see. Some of the operators that are bringing new capacity have already kind of extended the timeline when they thought that the tonnes would be into the market. So we think that the testament that market price is now and even in North America are up $20 a tonne, spot prices in Brazil are up, I think that that's all good signs that the market is strong and getting healthier. For our guidance -- when we look at our production and our sales, it's up a relatively small amount, 3%. Last year the combined pro forma company was up much more than that. And I don't have the exact market shares, but I would say that the journey is sort of a flat market share. And we're trying to sell a lot of those tonnes in the first half of the year, because that's where the demand is. And then we'll see what happens in the second half of the year. That's why we gave a range for guidance. But I think we're quite aware of the market dynamics. We like how the market is improving. It's getting healthier.

27,2684,Jason Newton,"[""I think there's a few things leading to the high amount of demand growth that we saw last year. Number one is that we saw stable and firming pricing environment which gave downstream buyers confidence in the market to take a position. But also if you look at the price of potash even where it has increased to today, it's very affordable at the farm level compared to crop prices. And historically when we're seeing that combination of steady and increasing prices at affordable levels, we've seen firm demand growth. And that's what we saw last year. If we look at inventories in 4 of the major markets, so North America, China, India and Brazil, what we've seen -- and there definitely isn't perfect inventory data downstream, but the inventory data that we've seen in those markets is down about 5% year-over-year. So obviously we're seeing a lot go to ground. In the North American market, we have the insight from our retail group that says that fall demand was very strong, channel inventories were tight at the end of the year and we expect to see flat demand in the first half of the year within North America. I think the second half is more of a question mark, so we're a bit conservative on the shipment range. But that's just driven by how strong the fall application season was this year and we've really seen limited build in inventories.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017

That's why they hit a record potash demand in Brazil. And we think that that phenomena will continue over the foreseeable future. In India and China, the governments are starting to mandate now soil sampling by their farmers and our intelligence would suggest that the data is quite worrisome and I think that finally they're starting to see that if they don't change the soil health dynamics, they could have long lasting implications.

But wasn't running Rocanville full out and running PotashCorp mines -- other mines at lower rate a key and well established multi-year plan from PotashCorp as a standalone company. So if you're not shutting out other mines, how is that a synergy?""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017
35,2692,Chuck Magro,"[""So, look, the way we're thinking about this in terms of phosphate is it's a synergy simply because we have -- we think we have multiple path. And I have to tell you we're not decided yet, but what we're trying to do is minimize the amount of capital spend. But we have a channel in Western Canada with 280 retail facilities, so we have a captive demand channel there and we are trying to find the lowest cost way to get the finished product into that channel. And then if we repurpose our Redwater facility -- is it exactly $80 million? No, Susan didn't say that. We'll give you the exact numbers probably as soon as we make the final decision. But it's going to certainly be in that ballpark and it's going to be a combination of I think changes, the shipping changes in terms of a margin enhancement from, let's say, the Southeast part of the US and repurposing our Redwater business. We think actually the synergy could be very close to the $80 million, maybe even a bit more. And we're just finishing the analysis on that. Now, to your potash question, obviously it has been a longstanding legacy PotashCorp issue to get Rocanville up to capacity. The difference now in terms of where the synergies lie will be on 2 fronts. When you add Vanscoy into the mix, we are able then to further shift the demand -- because you've got to remember that with the Vanscoy production comes the Vanscoy sales book. And so when you look at that, we need to line up the assets and look at where the cost optimization is. And last year we said it publically Rocanville produced 5 million tones. So if we could get Rocanville up to 6 million tonnes because of the demand we have and then the other lower cost plants, that is clearly an operational synergy without impacting the overall potash market. And that's what we're highly sensitive to. So there is a cost optimization of the network. There is a way to save cost, to share resources, to reduce the overall fixed cost of these facilities by shifting the tonnes and rebalancing the headcount and the fixed cost. So we've said many times in the past that we used to run Vanscoy in what I would consider it to be a fairly unnatural state, because we had one line and we needed to make the spring season. And so overtime cost and things like that were excessive, because we needed to make sure that we delivered the tonnes to the market. All of those cost savings now are going to be part of the synergy bucket and we won't have to run any of our plants in an unnatural state. And once you do that, the costs will come down quite substantially.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017

Also, in our facility down in Borger, in Texas, as you recall, we started that up in January of this year.

65,2722,John Chu,"[""So just on the M&A front. I know you're really focused on growing the Retail side of the business whether it's domestically or internationally. But with all the mega mergers going on and even a couple that might be happening soon or rumored to happen soon, there might be some asset divestures in other areas such as seed and crop protection where you can actually add to your product portfolio. So how does that come into play if something like that becomes available and do you change your priorities or is it still going to be focused on the Retail side?""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017
66,2723,Chuck Magro,"[""So, look, we think we have a very good plan to build out Retail, consolidate the space and create value. And it's a pretty simple plan. We're going to continue to do our tuck-in programs in North America, consolidate the space. We will look at backward integration in terms of the Loveland products portfolio. That has been a huge winner for us and really a key driver of our earnings over the last 2 or 3 years. The international expansion into Brazil now is finally in motion and we've talked about that over the last few years and we see tremendous opportunity in that space. And that's going to be probably the core pillars of growth. Mike did also communicate that we are actively investing in our digital offerings. Like all distribution companies, we're really focused on that as well and you could see us get active in that area as well. Now, to your question on crop protection or seed, we're always looking for parts of portfolios that will fit into our overall offering and drive yields up for our growers and so we would absolutely be interested in parts of those portfolios that would make sense. But we passed on a lot of them over the last few years because we've been selective. But if something came along that would fit with I think our view of where the market is going, what our growers need, we would absolutely look at all of those opportunities.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017

69,2726,Chuck Magro,"[""Yes, it's a good question, John. So, look, the way we're focused right now is we need to deliver the synergy number that we've put out there and the market is not working entirely with us right now. So we're focused on optimizing what we have and really extracting as much value out of that as we can. Susan mentioned it. I'll just restate it, though. It's prudent after a merger like the one we just went through to look at all of our businesses and determine the long-term strategic fit, what kind of capital or investment would be required to take it to the next level and where the best returns are for our shareholders. And phosphate will be part of that among many other parts of our portfolio and we'll make those decisions sort of as we get through 2018 and into 2019. But I would tell you right now, John, our primary focus is improving the business and getting after the synergies.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017

73,2730,Susan Jones,"[""Yes, I think, Alex, probably the best way to look at this is you need to really look at it on a margin basis versus realized price basis. So just to give you a sense of -- we obviously are seeing the firm prices right now due to sulfur and ammonia prices increasing. But really from our perspective, it really comes down to the overall margin and that's where we did have good volumes out of our legacy PCS for last quarter, we did see prices rise and we have the seed and industrial businesses a bit more squeezed. But at the end of the day, it comes down to a margins discussion as supposed to just looking at the realized prices.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208091,54,NTR.TO,4,2018-02-06 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q4 2017,2017
