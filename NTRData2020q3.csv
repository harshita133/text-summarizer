2,28,NTR.TO,NTR.TO_208034,3,2020-11-03 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q3 2020,2020,1323,Charles Victor Magro,"[""Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone. First off, I hope you and your families are all safe and healthy. While most companies and industries have seen an impact to their business due to the COVID-19 pandemic, agriculture has been more resilient than most and is now demonstrating real strength as we head into 2021. This underscores the consistent growth in global food demand even through a global economic and health crisis. The fall application season is well underway across the U.S., as the harvest is ahead of normal. Crop prices have increased due to a combination of excellent global demand and lower-than-expected production, resulting in strong grower margins.Furthermore, fertilizer affordability is high, particularly for potash and nitrogen. As a result, we are optimistic of the fall application season will be good. And we are also positive on the outlook for 2021. Before turning to the overview of our third quarter results and the outlook, I'd like to provide context on the noncash impairment and tax benefit we recognized this quarter. The noncash impairment was mostly associated with our phosphate facilities in White Springs and Aurora. This is based on our expectation for a challenging long-term price outlook for phosphate, caused by structural oversupply from low-cost regions.Our tax rate was lower than usual this quarter due to a combination of U.S. legislation changes, the tax benefit of recognizing noncash impairments and a shift in the mix of jurisdictional earnings. Now turning to our Q3 results. Retail ag solutions reported 13% higher EBITDA in the first 9 months, which included double-digit growth in revenue and gross margin. We continue to deliver strong organic growth and realized the benefits from recent acquisitions.Our third quarter Retail ag solutions EBITDA was down $28 million over the last year, due primarily to the weather-related shift in earnings from Q2 into Q3 in 2019. The biggest variation was in crop protection and application services that were impacted by lower-than-expected U.S. acreage, relatively low discretionary crop protection product spend and very low insect pressure due to dry conditions in the corn belt.These factors, combined with supplier bundling programs, created additional competitive pressure in the crop protection market this quarter. However, on a year-to-date basis, our U.S. crop protection gross margins and percentage margins are both higher this year. We also continue to report EBITDA of over $1 million per U.S. selling location and retail margins of nearly 10% and significantly lower working capital over the past 12 months. In fact, retail inventory alone was reduced by over $400 million during this quarter.Retail ag solutions in Australia and South America delivered additional $31 million in EBITDA in the third quarter over the same period last year. The integration of Ruralco continues to proceed ahead of plan. And we have now hit our original synergy target of $30 million, and we also expect to capture an additional $20 million in synergies by the end of 2021 from this strategic acquisition. Uptake of our digital platform continues to exceed our expectations, and we have now surpassed the $1 billion in online sales, nearly 4x greater than the digital sales in all of 2019.The new functionalities, such as our digital seed recommendation and crop planning tools, are also being rolled out this year. We will provide a virtual demonstration of our digital platform leading up to our November 30 investor update, and we'll introduce new metrics to help illustrate the benefits of our leading digital tool for both our customers and for our business.Moving to the Q3 results for our wholesale operations. Our Potash operating results from a production, sales and cost perspective were impressive again. Potash demand was strong in the third quarter, both domestically and offshore. Canpotex is fully committed into early 2021, and our domestic order book is nearly full for the balance of this year. Our cash cost of production was $9 per tonne lower than 2019, partly due to production efficiency gains. We do have maintenance turnaround scheduled at 3 of our mines in the fourth quarter, which will increase per tonne cost and limit sales availability. However, we still expect 2020 to be our best year from a cost perspective.For nitrogen this quarter, we reported excellent operating rates, lower cost and higher ag-related sales volumes, largely associated with our summer fill program. However, nitrogen adjusted EBITDA was down 21%, due to lower nitrogen prices and lower industrial and feed volumes due to reduced global industrial demand, largely associated with the impact of COVID-19. We made the difficult decision to indefinitely curtail production at our smallest ammonia plant in Trinidad because of uncompetitive gas costs. And we are now operating the rest of the complex at full operating rates. With U.S. harvest near complete and a clear line of sight on our potash and nitrogen businesses to the year-end, our guidance is intact, and we have narrowed the annual adjusted earnings guidance to $1.60 to $1.85 per share and our adjusted EBITDA guidance to $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion.Now shifting to our outlook for the global crop input sector. Overall, the fundamentals for our business have strengthened over the past quarter. As the grain and oilseed supply demand has tightened significantly, corn and soybean prices have increased 25% to 30% over the past 2 months. U.S. grower margins for key crops are up close to 50% compared to the previous 3 year average and are the strongest they have been in many years. This will create incentives to increase planting and crop input applications in the U.S. and other regions next year.Prices of most major crops in China have increased significantly as a result of tight domestic supply and demand fundamentals, particularly for feed grains as the hog herd quickly recovers from African swine fever. We believe the increased demand for both Chinese feed and food is structural, and we expect elevated grains and oilseed imports into 2021 and beyond that. Record crop prices in Brazil are expected to boost summer soybean and Safrinha corn planting by around 5%. While planting was delayed by dry weather, farmers have made significant progress in recent weeks.Grower sentiment is extremely strong and underscores why expanding our business in Brazil is strategically important. Harvest is in full swing in Australia, and growers are working to get a bumper crop into the bins, and crop prices remained strong. Following harvest, the weather outlook is for favorable rainfalls, which could set Australian farmers up for another successful season. Potash prices strengthened as global demand is strong, and we maintain our 2020 global potash shipment forecast at 65 million to 67 million tonnes. With increased consumption in all key regions, including China, the market conditions have tightened significantly, and we are taking domestic orders at $30 per tonne above our summer fill program.Reports indicate that most of the major suppliers are sold out for the rest of 2020. Canpotex will not place product into China warehouses after October 30 contract expires, and other key markets are on sales allocation. We believe that potash reached floor levels early in 2020.For nitrogen, we believe there was little growth in global demand this year due to the macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19. This significantly reduced industrial demand, which we expect has delayed the recovery in nitrogen by about a year. However, strong urea demand in India and Brazil, combined with lower supply from China has provided the market with stability, and the recent increase in natural gas prices, especially in Europe, should help support global nitrogen pricing.Ammonia prices have also firmed over the past few months. In North America, urea prices are likely to rise to close the gap against global benchmark pricing. While there is still some new nitrogen capacity coming online, the regions where most of this new capacity is located have encountered significant delays or have low historic operating rates. With limited new supply after 2021, growing demand, higher global energy prices and an expected recovery in the global economy, we expect the nitrogen market to tighten over time.Nutrien expects to lead the next wave of innovation and sustainability in agriculture. And in the first half of 2021, we will lay out our climate targets and commitments, which include tools that can fundamentally change sustainable agriculture. We will provide more details on this at our Investor Day on November 30, and we encourage you to sign up for this on our website. As we look at -- to 2021, we believe the fundamentals for our business are strengthening. And while we execute on closing out a solid 2020, we see compelling drivers for improved results across our businesses in 2021.We would now open the call to your questions on the quarter and the outlook for our business.""]",management_discussion

So just to your specific question on nitrogen, yes, we are looking at our nitrogen footprint and our product slate. And what I'd say is, even if you look at our product slate today, 1/3 of our ammonia sales today would be from low carbon. So if you use the phrase blue ammonia, about 1/3 of our sales would already come from that. So we're already a leader today in low-carbon ammonia production.

John, so look, we're certainly more optimistic overall at the end of the third quarter than we were at the end of the first and second quarter. And it's for the reasons we outlined in the prepared remarks. We've seen crop prices rally. Six months ago, we were talking about sub-$3 corn. Now we're talking about $4 corn. Inventories have tightened. And demand around the world for crops is increasing substantially, including in China. So we are feeling better and certainly more confident as we enter 2021.Now specific to potash, yes. I would say, look, if you look at overall the potash fundamentals, they've improved throughout this year. Certainly, when we think about demand, demand is up about 2 million tonnes. That would be our guess today. So that has really been a nice event in the industry. And we think 2021, demand will continue to grow. We also think that globally inventories are where they should be at this time of year. And so what we think will happen is that you're going to see the potash market continue to grow. There is a little bit of more new supply that needs to come into the market, but the growth should easily absorb that.And if you look at Nutrien's position, we said very clearly on the prepared remarks that Canpotex is not shipping product into China now that the contract has expired. We do believe that inland inventories are low in China and that they need the product. And potash domestic pricing in China is quite a bit higher than the contract pricing. So all this bodes well, I think, for a good contract negotiation as we enter 2021.And overall, I think we're seeing demand not only in China, but in all the core markets for potash. So yes, we're feeling a little bit better about the potash market. And for us, we are also focused on our costs. So another quarter of $52, $53 cash cost. It shows the integration that we've done since the merger and the investments that we've put into the potash business.And I think we're well prepared to continue to focus on low cost. And as the market grows, we'll be able to put more tonnes into the market at lower cost. So we like that position as we head into 2021.""]",question_answer

We look at the portfolio. We're constantly optimizing our overall portfolio. And when it comes to the specifics around the integrated model, we actually look at that with some frequency. And we monitor sum of the parts, of course, as well as other valuation metrics that we have. And it's not only the management team that does this. We put this in front of the Board with some frequency, just to ensure that we've got the right strategy with the right structure to drive long-term shareholder value.What I'd tell you right now, though, is that when we look at the market conditions, the volatility and how our company has performed relative to other players in the crop input space, we would say that the integrated model has shone through. And that if you look at our free cash flow and our earnings, we've been a much more stable investment than many of our peers because of the way the company is structured.And then if you look at how we have allocated capital, the reason we have the dividend policy that we have as Nutrien is because of the integrated model. And at this point, in the market, whether it's the economic market or the industry that we're operating in, in terms of crop inputs, we have a really attractive dividend policy. It's very stable. It's growing. And with interest rates the way they are today, it's a very attractive investment for shareholders.And many of the shareholders that I talked to love this model where at the bottom of our cycle, which is where we think we are today, shareholders are getting paid a very healthy dividend to wait for the market to recover, which we hope now is on our doorsteps. And then as the market does recover, we still have significant leverage to the upside. So the integrated model, I think, has been proven to show that we have less downside risk and still significant leverage to the upside.And I think most shareholders would agree that, that is a unique combination for companies in the material and industrial space.""]",question_answer

So Chuck talked about China and why we're confident there, and that's owing to, yes, some inventories that are a bit above 3 million tonnes at the moment, but we're seeing strong demand there into the fall. And it's reflected in the domestic price, low inline inventories as well. So as the lowest potash price market in the world, we're confident about good contract negotiation in 2021, and we expect demand, as usual, to be robust in China. India, we're going to end the year with lower inventories year-over-year than we've seen, lower than historic averages. India has been a great year. And into the fall season with their kharif crop, we expect that Indian farmer economics will continue to be very good. And so we expect strong demand in India in 2021 as well.Indonesia and Malaysia, you can see that the palm oil price is now north of MYR 30 to MYR 100 per tonne, and that bodes very well for the plantation owners in terms of potash affordability. So we're expecting growth in Southeast Asia into 2021. The Brazilian market continues to be very strong as well. And again, in 2021, we expect some growth there. But the farmer economics and farmer affordability for potash are just excellent in Brazil.And then finally, in the U.S., we're having a very strong fall into the U.S. We have a great weather, great farmer affordability, and we're seeing strong potash application into the fall. And so that tees us up well for lower inventories across the board and then into 2021, expecting -- yes, demand growth, as Chuck said, and favorable pricing as well.""]",question_answer

So Jacob, I'll talk about guidance, and then Mike can give you -- Mike Frank can give you his perspective on what he sees going forward towards the end of the year and then into 2021. So look, overall, what we did with guidance is we just took the top end of the EBITDA guidance range down. There were some minor tweaks in potash and nitrogen. Potash was raised modestly because of higher volumes and prices as the last question was addressing, and nitrogen was lower just modestly because of pricing and then slightly higher gas costs.Our biggest change in our guidance overall was to Retail. And that is a bit unusual for Q3 in Retail. But I think that this year what we've seen is, if you look at why we lowered the guidance in Retail, there are 3 drivers to that. The first is the lower planet acreage. So the USDA was still tweaking their numbers as late as of October. So we were expecting, and I think many others would be expecting higher planted acreage in -- throughout the year. And we -- now we know that we had a softer Q3 because of that.But also crop protection, application in the third quarter was lower. We had dry weather in the corn belt and not a lot of pest pressure. So that was another driver. And then the last topic, which I did introduce in my prepared remarks, which is we have seen some deflationary pricing in the crop protection market because of some competitive pressure in the upstream competitors. And that when we combine all that, what I would say to you is that we certainly think that most of this is just Q3 specific.But I'll have Mike give his view on crop protection as we get through the rest of this year and into 2021. So go ahead, Mike.""]",question_answer

So look, if you look at our 2020 crop protection margins, obviously, they were strong through the first half and deteriorated in Q3. And as Chuck just mentioned, I mean, a big part of the Q3 impact was the fact that there was lower, especially in the corn belt, insect and disease acres for us to treat. The channel, ourselves included, were loaded up with inventory. And so it ended up being a hypercompetitive market. And we saw the margins deteriorate because of that. I think that's a unique event this year. We haven't seen that in the past. And so I wouldn't expect that to repeat.The other impact that we're going to see through the whole year is just the impact of Ruralco on our crop protection margins. Like if we look at the year-to-date Ruralco crop protection margins, they're about 13%. And typically, our Australia margins are close to where we have globally. They're in the 20% to 22% range. So with Ruralco, we had to sell off the existing inventory and the purchase commitments that they made for the 2020 season, we're pretty much through all of that inventory. And so as we look towards 2021, we'll also have Nutrien ag solutions costing across our whole Australia portfolio.

And they haven't increased by the same amount.

So I covered the potash, our view of potash, I think, pretty well globally from a fundamental perspective there. The nuance then, if you go back to China, what we're seeing in China, though, I think and it's early days, but we think there's some really interesting structural changes happening there. There's good demand for grains and oilseeds. You can see corn and soybean imports well above the historical levels. And China inventories have been depleted. So when we look at this and we see China pricing for potash, but also for food, it's much higher than the global benchmark prices.So what's happening is if you look at African swine fever, which was a major headwind for the industry last year, now that's becoming what we think a structural tailwind because as the Chinese rebuild their hog herd, they're doing it with, what I would call, professionalism and commercial aspects around the world and so they're bringing in professional commercial feed lots which are going to use a lot more crops. And I think that's a safer way to grow these animals, but it's also, I think, going to drive, I think, a change in demand for crops around the world. And so all of this is positive, I think, for crop fundamentals, but also for NPK.And so that's why you've noticed maybe a slight change in our view now, is that we've been watching this for the last, I'd say, 6 to 9 months.

So look, I'll stay at the high level, and then certainly, we can unpack this, if you like, or we can take it off-line. But what we've seen in the nitrogen fundamentals is sort of that the recovery has probably been pushed out by about a year or so that we had originally thought. And if there's one part of our business, but also the ag industry that has been impacted by COVID, it is the nitrogen industry.The rest of our businesses have not been really overly impacted. There's been puts and takes around crop mix and things like that. But the nitrogen industry, because a part of it is industrial and it goes into the general economy, what we've seen is that global demand overall for nitrogen is going to be up modestly, I'll call it, flat. Good demand growth in ag, but of course, declines around the world for industrial nitrogen. And then some of the new production that was intended to come online late last year and then earlier this year, that also has been pushed out.So as we look at 2021, our view would be that we're going to see growth in nitrogen next year in ag, but also in the industrial complex as the broader economy recovers. The new supply will come online. And what we would say is that 2021 from a nitrogen perspective is probably more balanced for 2021 than we had originally thought. As compared to potash, where we see very good demand growth in potash, there is a more -- some supply coming on in potash, but we think that the supply/demand in potash will tighten next year.

So looking at the export balances, we expect Chinese urea exports this year will be in the 5 million tonne range, so roughly in line with where it was a year ago.And as we look toward next year, the combination of increased demand domestically and some continued supply reductions in the domestic market, we'd expect that domestic -- the exports will decline. So probably in the range of 1 million tonne decline in Chinese exports of urea in 2021. Phosphate, we've already seen lower exports this year, and we expect to continue that same trend of increased consumption domestically in 2021, which should reduce the export surplus there.And then on the potash side, we have seen increased domestic consumption in 2020.

The vast majority, over 90% of the OpEx increase this year is coming from acquisitions, in particular, Ruralco, but we also had a couple of medium-sized acquisitions in Brazil. And so that's where we're seeing OpEx growth this year. Right now going into 2021, we don't have those big acquisitions at this time that are going to have that same kind of impact into our 2021 year. And so I would expect a more stable OpEx growth going into next year, probably less than inflation.Look, in terms of grower sentiment, you're right, whether it's the U.S., obviously, it was an early harvest, good yield, strong prices right now. And good government support programs. And we're seeing that play out. Our seed bookings are up. We've had a record October from a tonne standpoint in terms of getting applications, fertilizer on the ground. And we've also seen a record number of soil samples come into our Waypoint Analytical lab network. And so we are seeing growers really starting to think about how do they make investments into the '21 crop that are going to really be focused on maximizing yields.Of course, it's the same in Brazil, grower margins are extremely strong. And in Australia, they're just about to harvest what looks to be a really good crop and moisture conditions are once again looking positive going into the '21 season. So across the board, I would say all those things are setting up right now for really strong grower fundamentals. And when that's the case, there is a positive impact, of course, on our retail business from product sales margins. And obviously, there's a lot to play out in terms of planted acres for '21 between corn and soy.But as Chuck mentioned in the prepared remarks, there was about 8 million acres that didn't get planted this year because of revamp plant.

Look, I think the way we think about this coming contract with China is fundamentally different than what happened over the last couple of years. So if you recall, we signed and we being Canpotex signed a contract only until October. So it wasn't even 12 months last time. I think we made it very clear that we fundamentally believe that the contract price was not sustainable at that level. And Canpotex is now not shipping any volume after the contract in October. So I think that, that is a very important differentiation and distinction.And then if you look at how we're forecasting our volumes into 2021, and we'll talk more about that as we enter the new year is, we don't -- we're not relying on China for a lot of volume early in 2021. And then the comment that we've already made a couple of times today, the China domestic potash price is much higher than that contract price.

So the Chinese understand that.But from my perspective, what I would say is that I believe that there's only one way potash prices are going to go in China, the question is just by how much.""]",question_answer

So Michael, obviously, the platform has exceeded our expectations this year in terms of revenue that's come in on the digital portal. Obviously, that was aided by COVID, where we got into the March busy season. And we wanted to make sure that both our employees and our customers stayed safe and healthy. And so we really turned to the digital tools and leverage them in that window. But the good thing is we've seen that continue through the third quarter and even in the early start of the fourth quarter. So look, I think the benefits, there's really 2 big categories of benefits that we're seeing.Firstly, it's around efficiency. So our best sales agronomists that are at capacity doing it the old way. With these digital tools, they're able to increase the number of acres that they can serve by probably 25% to 40%. Just because that these tools allowed them to reach their growers and help their growers make decisions in a more convenient way. And we're also seeing a less duplication of kind of back office work.And so there's also a leaning down of the administration that we're seeing, and we can anticipate as we do more and more transactions on the digital portal and get more payments through the portal that it's leaning down our administration. The other big area of benefit is really, I would say, both grower convenience as well as our sales agronomists convenience. And we're seeing, for example, growers that are engaging online are churning less. They're more likely to buy multiple shelves from us.And so we do see this as an avenue. I think it's early days, but it's an avenue for us to drive organic growth as well.""]",question_answer

So look, I think we already talked about the crop protection market and the impact this year, in particular, the impact of Ruralco and the mix effect that Ruralco had on our overall margins as well as just a very competitive Q3 that obviously lowered our margins in the U.S. in Q3 as we sold through the inventory based on the smaller market. Now I would say on the seed side, look, if you look at our margins year-to-date, our margins are strong on seed. They're strong because we've performed well with our proprietary products seed portfolio. And I would say we've never had a stronger proprietary product seed portfolio than we have going into the '21 season. So we feel really good about that. And right now, again, I think based on positive grower sentiment, growers are focused on the seed that's going to help maximize yields so that they can take advantage of $10.40 soybeans or $4 corn. And so we're seeing actually in soybeans, probably a trading up, less Roundup Ready 2 soybeans, less Roundup Ready by LibertyLink soybeans. And we think that our overall ratio of both Enlist and Xtend and XtendFlex beans are going to be up this year. And so it's a competitive marketplace. But again, growers are focused on making sure they can get the best seed. And really, it's the same on the corn side.We're not seeing extraordinary competition, I would say, right now in seed. I mean the market is focused on getting the best seed, making sure that we have inventory of it. And that's where the focus is right now. It's more so there than it is on, I would say, on the price equation.""]",question_answer
