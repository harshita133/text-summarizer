Certain material assumptions were applied in making these conclusions and forecasts.

2,14,NTR.TO,NTR.TO_312688,1,2022-05-03 14:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2022,2022,638,Kenneth Seitz,"[""Thanks, Jeff. And good morning, and welcome to Nutrien's First Quarter Earnings Call. Before we get into the discussion of our results and outlook, I would like to express our thoughts and sympathies to all those that have been impacted by the conflict in Ukraine. We see the significant toll that has taken on the people in Ukraine, and it hits close to home for many of our employees, customers and other stakeholders that have family and friends in the region."", ""The conflict has also compounded supply challenges that have contributed to higher commodity prices and escalated concerns for global food security. Russia and Ukraine account for over 20% of the global exports for many agriculture and fertilizer commodities, and there's no simple or fast solution to overcome this level of supply disruption. As the world's largest fertilizer producer and retailer crop input, Nutrien has taken several actions to help our customers secure the products they need."", 'In Potash, we are expanding production capability to approximately 15 million tonnes in 2022, an increase of 1 million tonnes compared to our initial expectations. This represents a nearly 20% increase compared to 2020 and accounts for more than 70% of global potash production added during this time. We have expanded our nitrogen production capacity by nearly 1 million tonnes since the beginning of 2018 and are in the process of adding an additional 0.5 million tonnes over the next few years, while improving the carbon footprint of our facilities.', ""Our Retail business operates in 7 countries across North America, South America and Australia. These are key agricultural regions that will be called on to sustainably increase crop production. And our team of 3,900 crop consultants work every day to provide innovative products and solutions that meet the needs of our grower customers. I'm extremely proud of how our people have stepped up across the organization, as we respond to this critical time for global agriculture and do so in a manner that does not compromise our core values of safety and integrity."", 'Now turning to our Q1 results and outlook. We delivered higher earnings across each of our business units due to the strength of the market fundamentals, advantaged position of our assets and solid execution by our people. The year-over-year growth in earnings was further supported by recent strategic capital allocation decisions that included expanding our production capabilities and increasing the size of share buybacks over the past 2 quarters.', 'Nutrien Ag Solutions delivered record first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $240 million despite a delayed start to the spring season in North America. Our per tonne crop Nutrien margins remained strong due to the timing of procurement in a rising price environment and continued growth in our proprietary nutritional products. We delivered higher crop protection gross margins, as growers engaged early to purchase product ahead of the spring season. We strategically procured inventory of certain products in anticipation of tight global supply and our margins in Q1 reflect this effort.', ""Potash delivered $1.4 billion in adjusted EBITDA, supported by higher realized prices. Global demand was strong as buyers look to secure product in the midst of supply uncertainty from Belarus and Russia. We increased offshore potash sales volumes by 8% compared to the previous year. However, shipments were impacted by rail service interruptions during the quarter. North American sales volumes were impacted by a delayed start to the spring season and were down compared to last year's very strong first quarter."", 'In nitrogen, we generated adjusted EBITDA of $1 billion, driven by higher realized prices and the cost advantaged position of our assets. We experienced some unplanned outages during the quarter, and sales volumes were also impacted by a slow start to the spring season.', 'Phosphate delivered record adjusted EBITDA of $239 million as higher sales prices more than offset the large increase in ammonia and sulfur input costs.', 'Turning to the outlook. Global grain and oilseed inventories were well below historical average levels entering 2022, and the conflict in Ukraine has led to further tightening of supplies. Corn, soybean and wheat futures prices are 50% to 90% above the 10-year average and are trading at elevated levels on a multiyear basis.', 'Prospective crop margins are significantly above historical average levels as the increase in revenues from higher crop prices has more than exceeded the projected increase in input costs. Weather permitting, we expect planted acreage to increase in the key agricultural regions in which we operate with the strong incentives for growers to maximize production. The North American spring planting season is behind the historical average pace, but there is still time to get the crop in the ground, and our retail network is well positioned to deliver in a compressed season.', 'We are seeing strong demand in the regions where planting has progressed and have all-time high customer prepayments on account, which is a good indicator of grower intent.', 'Financial sanctions and other restrictions imposed on Russia and Belarus have constrained potash supply with minimal exports from this region reported since early March. These 2 countries represent approximately 40% of global potash exports, and there is limited available for production capacity in other regions to help fill this supply gap.', 'Therefore, we expect global potash shipments will decline to between 60 million and 65 million tonnes in 2022, and we assume a wider-than-normal range given the level of supply uncertainty from Eastern Europe. Nutrien expects to ship record potash volumes between 14.5 million to 15.1 million tonnes, with most of the growth projected in offshore markets.', 'We expect nitrogen markets to remain strong through 2022 due to lower Russian exports and volatile European gas prices that are currently setting the floor for ammonia and urea prices. Chinese urea exports have been restricted in the first half of 2022, and we believe there is potential for restrictions in the second half if the government intends on maintaining the current discount for Chinese domestic prices compared to other global markets.', 'We are discussing these supply challenges in the context of 2022; however, we believe these issues could extend well beyond this year. Sanctions on Russia and Belarus have the potential to create more lasting changes to global trade patterns, as customers prioritize reliability of supply. We anticipate volatility in global energy prices due to greater supply uncertainty from Russia.', 'And we expect some delays in the development of a new capacity from this region as access to financing, equipment and other resources becomes more challenging. We will closely monitor global market developments, as we assess opportunities to increase our potash production capability beyond 15 million tonnes. Increasing production on a sustained basis requires opening up new ground, installing additional equipment and infrastructure, hiring more people and securing outbound logistics. These are decisions that require careful planning, as they have long-term impacts on our operations and our people.', 'We intend to provide more details at our virtual investor update meeting on June 9. I will now turn it over to Pedro to review how we expect these market conditions to impact our 2022 guidance and our approach to capital allocation going forward. Pedro?']",management_discussion
3,14,NTR.TO,NTR.TO_312688,1,2022-05-03 14:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2022,2022,639,Pedro Farah,"[""Thanks, Ken. Given the significant changes in market fundamentals, we have increased our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $14.5 billion to $16.5 billion. At the midpoint, this represents a nearly 50% increase from our initial full year guidance in February. We expect earnings to be fairly evenly split between the first and second half of the year with the pace of planting [indiscernible] to have some impact on the timing of earnings between quarters. We are projecting Retail adjusted EBITDA between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion. And crop nutrient and crop protection margins are expected to be stronger than previously anticipated. Crop prices have risen materially since the beginning of the year, and we expect growers will be incentivized to maximize yields, which typically contributes to strong in-season demand for crop protection and specialty nutritional products.\r\nSimilar to previous years, we expect 60% to 65% of Retail's adjusted EBITDA will be generated in the second quarter. We significantly increased our potash adjusted EBITDA guidance due to the expectation for higher realized prices and increased sales volumes. Cost of goods sold per tonne are expected to increase in 2022 due primarily to higher royalties, which are directly tied to selling prices."", 'Excluding the impact of royalties, natural gas and carbon taxes, we expect considerable cash costs to be comparable with the previous years, as higher production volumes offset inflation. Our increase in nitrogen adjusted EBITDA guidance reflects higher global benchmark prices and a very competitive cost position compared to producers in Europe.', 'We lower our nitrogen sales volume expectation due to the plant outages that occurred in Q1. We are taking a number of actions to enhance plant reliability, including incremental investments to protect our sites from severe weather events and expect higher operating rates over the remainder of 2022.', 'We expect to generate $10.5 billion to $11 billion in cash from operating activities, assuming a cash conversion ratio of approximately 70% at the midpoint of our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance range. This represents a slightly lower conversion rate that we assume in February, as the increase in input prices is expected to translate into greater working capital requirements in this period. The majority of our cash flow is expected to be generated in the second and the fourth quarters due to the seasonal working capital profile of Retail.', 'Our priorities for investment capital remain very consistent with our long-term strategy and what we communicated in February. However, given the potential for increased cash flow, we are evaluating the viability to accelerate a few high-return growth opportunities. We announced a 1 million tonne increase to our potash production capability in March, which will require a small incremental capital investments for mine phasing equipment and mine development. As Ken already mentioned, we are closely looking at the potential to further ramp our potash production capability above 15 million tonnes.', 'We are evaluating opportunities across our nitrogen business that would enhance the product mix and improve the environmental footprint of our facilities, including expanding our leading low-carbon ammonia position.', 'In Retail, there is a strong pipeline of acquisition opportunities in Brazil and the U.S., and we will maintain a disciplined approach, as we evaluate these opportunities.', 'In terms of capital -- in terms of investment capital, our focus is on initiatives that enhance our proprietary product business and digital capabilities, which are key drivers of Retail organic growth. We committed to a minimum of $2 billion in share repurchases in 2022. And year-to-date, we have allocated nearly $740 million, repurchasing approximately 9 million shares at an average price of around $81 per share. Given the strength of our projected cash flow, we believe there is potential for additional shareholder returns as the year progresses.', 'We will provide a more in-depth update on our capital allocation plans at the Investor Update Meeting on June 9. I will now pass it back to Ken for final comments.']",management_discussion

The importance of global agriculture to help sustainably feed a growing world has never been clear.

They're probably the biggest change that we've seen in the potash market structure since the breakup of BPC, almost 10 years ago. And these effects seem to be relatively long lasting. So can you just talk about how the Belarus-Russia situation changes your longer-term view on the market?

So absolutely, it is the case that we watched this terrible tragedy unfolds in Eastern Europe and thinking about people in the region every day. We are watching the impacts that sanctions are having first, as you mentioned, on Belarus and Russia as well.', ""And while potash itself is not sanctioned in Russia, certainly, the enabling activities for export of anything out of Russia at the moment are challenged, whether it's banking or shipping or insurance and so on. So -- and then, of course, with Belarus, the sanctions were there prior to this conflict and having really no access, tidewater being shut off from the ports in Lithuania. So as these things have unfolded, as you say, Andrew, we're looking at duration and how long this might last and the longer-term implications for potash. And we're coming to the conclusion, as we said in the opening remarks, that these could last well beyond 2022, and hence, are looking at our own capabilities accordingly."", ""But I'll hand it over to Jason Newton, our Chief Economist, to just provide a little more color.""]",question_answer

I think in terms of overall supply-demand impact, certainly, there's a really large potential for supply constraints in 2022 just given, as Ken mentioned, the restrictions on Belarusian shipment to tidewater and all of different sanctions impacting Russian production."", 'In terms of quantifying the impact, if we compare to the sort of base operational capability in Belarus around 13 million tonnes, operational capability in Russia around 15 million tonnes. We think Belarusian supplies will be down around 6 million to 8 million tonnes this year and Russia in the range of 2 million to 6 million tonnes this year.', 'Going forward, it will take some time to rebuild those export capabilities. And we believe Belarus will continue to be most restricted going forward, as they have the need to rebuild or build port capacity, which takes time especially in the face of sanctions. And then we also know that, that region makes up about 60% to 70% of the capacity additions that we expect to come forward over the next 5 years. And we believe those will also be delayed going forward. So in any case, we have a tighter supply-demand outlook going forward than we would have previously.']",question_answer

And maybe just, Andrew, then finally, your question about Canpotex and that vantage point. It is the case that really growers around the world with -- what's happened with commodity prices are incentive to lay down appropriate crop nutrients. And then you layer on that some of the challenges that Jason just described and you can imagine that Canpotex, their phones are ringing as people look for alternative sources of supply."", ""Could it be that global trade routes are disrupted? I think we're seeing that today. But suffice it to say that certainly, from a global demand perspective, Canpotex has homes for potash and for increased levels of potash. And that's what's driving, as we said in our opening comments, us looking at the potential to accelerate our ramp-up of potash production.""]",question_answer

Just given the outlook and the potential longevity of the, let's say, the current situation and the shortfall, and even if growers in certain regions skip applications, presumably nutrients are still being removed from the soil on an annualized basis, there are a lot of things to consider. Very simple question. What will it take for you to eventually make a decision to ramp even further? I understand, obviously, there are economic considerations, longevity, so on and so forth."", 'And the remainder of that question will be, I mean, who else even has the capacity to make a dent in that shortfall between 2022 and 2024?

Well, I'll start with the second question and just say that, no, it is going to be a challenge. If we believe these supply challenges are going to persist through 2022 and into 2023, if there was additional capacity to put in the market, it would already be there because the incentives are certainly there for a producer to produce."", ""We'll also say that some of the new volumes that would have been coming -- would be coming to the market are out of that region, out of Russia and that's -- whether it's EuroChem or Belarus with their  petro corp project. And we can imagine that those projects are also challenged today. So it's -- if we look at the ability to flex production, a lot of it resides with Nutrien. Hence, over the last 2 years, 70% of the new production, that's come to the market, has been from Nutrien and our ability to add 20% to our own production volumes over the last 2 years."", ""With respect to your question, what does it take to ramp further? Well, of course, we're looking at that right now. But it goes back to just us assessing the duration of this impact and what it will actually the impact on the market in terms of trade patterns, and ultimately, restrictions potentially to certain parts of the world. And we know that's going to happen this year, hence, our 60 million to 65 million tonne guidance range where we expect there will be demand rationing -- much different than demand destruction, but demand rationing."", ""So we -- there is an acceleration case for our volumes.

Could you just talk about maybe internally and within Canpotex and in the broader North American logistics system, where you see kind of the bigger bottlenecks to increasing capacity? Obviously, there's about 3 million tonnes of hoisting and processing capacity that's still idled [indiscernible] bunch of it and some of the other mines as well. But as you think about beyond that, whether it's ports, whether it's railcars, whether you think it's big restraints around new mining machines, just help us think about what the key bottlenecks from a time perspective would be and where the bigger capital kind of requirements would come to think about the 3 million tonnes that you have still potential internally built and even beyond that?""]",question_answer

Our capacity is not just at the mines, but right through to the discharge ports for the customer. And so we're in the bottlenecks, and today, we would say that we're looking very closely at long lead time items from a procurement perspective."", 'And so that would be things like mining machines, which in order to accelerate ramp-up, we would need to put mining machines on order. And the downstream of that, we would say that with conveyance, we have to put in place. But the rest of it, we have built that capacity exactly as you say, capacity advance and our other mines where we have the infrastructure in place. We have the 12 shafts sunk, and we have mill capacity to ramp up production as well. So capital associated with production at the mine, but downstream of the mining machine is immaterial.', ""As we look beyond the mine gate and downstream from there, yes, it's true that cycle times are going to require more railcars and we're going to require port capacity. The good thing is that Canpotex has invested at the Neptune facility, Portland facility and our East Coast facility in New Brunswick, which gives them sufficient port capacity today to wrap up. So it really becomes a discussion about ordering railcars, which we can do."", ""And then I would say with respect to our North American distribution, we feel very well positioned there. We have our Lima facility. We have our over 300 warehouses across North America, and again, railcars to get it there.

We continue to see opportunity there and certainly watching that competitive landscape."", ""But I'll hand it over to Mark Thompson to talk a little bit more, who heads up our M&A work in Brazil, and then maybe over to Jeff Tarsi to just talk about our operations there. So Mark?""]",question_answer

So I think your question is really on how the competitive landscape is shaping up in the distribution part of the Brazilian market structure. And so obviously, there's multiple layers to the market structure in Brazil in terms of ultimately how growers are served. And as you've noted, the fertilizer distribution segment of that market has become relatively consolidated, and there has been some acquisition of assets by some of the Russian fertilizer companies and competitors in that space."", ""As you know, our business is really more of a direct-to-grower high-touch, high-service model in that market. And obviously, we've been quite forthcoming about our strategy that's been in place for multiple years about growing our presence in Brazil and helping growers be more productive and boost yields and adopt more technology in the company -- in the country, pardon me. So in the past few years, we've obviously completed 5 acquisitions. We've deployed about $300 million in enterprise value in the country."", ""And we've built one of the largest multi-region businesses in Brazil today. And really, it's sort of segment that's 1 level closer to the ground than where the consolidation in the fertilizer distribution space has been. So we now have over 50 locations. We've got over 10 experience centers. We've got fertilizer blending, soybean seed production and nutritional formulation directly in the country."", ""And as we look forward from an M&A standpoint in Brazil, we see a healthy pipeline ahead of us notwithstanding the fact that we are building a large presence there and have already begun to amass one. We're still only about 1% to 2% of the ag retail market in Brazil. So it's a very attractive growth market for us and leaves us a lot of room to run going forward, as that part of the industry continues to consolidate and professionalize. So maybe I'll just hand it over to Jeff Tarsi for any more comments that you might have.""]",question_answer

Mark, those are great comments and really not a lot more to add except to the fact that I think you said it and I'll say it again, is that continues to be an extremely attractive growth opportunity for Nutrien Ag Solutions as it relates to Retail. Look, we've had dual strategies there. Mark's talked about the acquisition opportunities. He also referenced our experience centers that we're putting in and which is kind of a new go-to-market type philosophy in that business."", ""André Dias, that leads that business for us, is very experienced in that market. And as we look that to add some new opportunities there, I think we'll look at them as a little bit more asset light than what we think of our markets here in North America. Those experience centers are hub-and-spoke-type centers where growers can come in and get the latest knowledge and technology and then their product is maybe shipped from a central supply point and standpoint. But we just -- we're gaining confidence by the date in our strategy in Brazil and our go-to approach there, and we're excited about what the future holds for us there.""]",question_answer
