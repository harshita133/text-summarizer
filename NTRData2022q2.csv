Before we get into the discussion of our results and outlook for the remainder of 2022, I would like to highlight 3 key messages."", 'First, we believe structural changes to global energy, agriculture and fertilizer markets will provide a supportive environment for Nutrien well beyond 2022. Second, we are accelerating strategic growth initiatives that leverage the unique advantages of our integrated business, generate excellent returns on invested capital and enhance our ability to provide sustainable solutions to help feed a growing world.', 'And third, we are committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation that supports growth and the sustainability of our business, while also returning meaningful capital to shareholders. In 2022, we expect to invest around $3 billion on sustaining and growth initiatives and distribute approximately $6 billion in capital to shareholders.', 'Pedro will walk through our plans in more detail later on in this call. Now turning to our results and outlook. Nutrien delivered record first half earnings driven by the strength of market fundamentals, the advantaged position of our global production assets and the excellent performance of retail.', 'We continue to progress our sustainability priorities and had excellent safety performance across the company, including a strong engagement in our serious injury and fatality prevention efforts, which is the most important work we do. Nutrien Ag Solutions had a record first half with adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.7 billion, up 38% from the prior year. The retail team delivered higher margins across nearly all products and geographies supported by the strength of our global supply chain and expanded offering of high-value products and services to growers.', 'Crop nutrient and crop protection margins were very strong due to strategic procurement in a rising price environment and growth in our proprietary nutritional products. North American fertilizer volumes were down in the first half to a combination of a very strong fall season in 2021, some crop mix shifts and a condensed application window this spring.', 'Fertilizer sales volumes outside of North America were up from the prior year, reflecting growth in our Brazilian retail network. Potash adjusted EBITDA increased to $3.4 billion in the first half, supported by higher realized prices and record offshore sales volumes.', 'Potash production increased by more than 5% compared to the first half of 2021, and controllable cash costs were relatively flat. The increase in production reduced our per tonne fixed costs and largely offset the impacts of inflation. Spot prices in Brazil and Southeast Asia were up significantly compared to the previous year, and Canpotex continued to prioritize its available volumes to these higher netback offshore markets.', 'In nitrogen, adjusted EBITDA in the first half increased to $2.2 billion as higher realized prices more than offset lower sales volumes and higher natural gas prices. The delayed start of the North American spring season impacted sales volumes, in particular, ammonia and UAN, and was a major contributor to the decline in nitrogen benchmark prices that occurred in the second quarter.', 'We had record phosphate adjusted EBITDA of $423 million in the first half as higher realized prices more than offset the large increase in ammonia and sulfur input costs. In the second quarter, we recognized a noncash impairment reversal of $450 million, which was driven by improved market fundamentals and a more favorable view of phosphate margins.', 'Turning to the outlook. Global grain and oilseed inventories remain historically low. The recent deal to reopen Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea would be a positive development for global food security if there is a sustained increase to shipments.', ""However, analysts believe volumes will continue to be challenged by labor and logistical constraints in addition to ongoing military strikes in the region. Ukraine's grain production and export levels are projected to be down dramatically compared to 2021, leaving little buffer for any supply issues in other regions this growing season."", 'U.S. grain conditions were generally favorable. However, high temperatures in July likely capped yield potential and record high temperatures in Europe have reduced summer crop yields. Crop commodity prices have been impacted over the past month by broader market volatility but are still 25% to 35% above the 10-year average, and futures are trading at elevated levels on a multiyear basis.', 'In North America, we expect strong grower demand in the third quarter for top dress nitrogen, special nutritional products and crop protection products. The crop was planted late, but is maturing rapidly with the recent hot weather, and we are planning for a normal application window this fall.', 'In Brazil, grower margins are strong and soybean planted area is expected to increase by 2% to 4%. Fertilizer inventories have been slow to move from port to inland positions as buyers look to purchase on a just-in-time basis. But we anticipate strong movement over the next 2 months to ensure product is available for the upcoming planting season.', 'In potash, much of the focus remains on supply challenges in Eastern Europe. Shipments from Russia and Belarus were down an estimated 25% and 50%, respectively, in the first half of 2022. Russian potash is not currently sanctioned, but has been impacted by restrictions on financing activities that facilitate exports.', 'The impact of sanctions on Belarus supply has been more significant due to the loss of access to tidewater through Lithuania. Belarus is reportedly shipping small volumes via container, which for a bulk commodity is a more costly and logistically challenging option.', 'We narrowed our global potash shipment forecast to between 61 million and 64 million tonnes in 2022 and expect shipments to be constrained by restrictions on exports from Russia and Belarus. Beyond the existing supply challenges, we see the potential for delays in the development of new potash capacity from this region, which was projected to be the source of approximately 60% of new potash supply, excluding Nutrien, over the next 5 years.', ""We expect nitrogen prices to strengthen in the second half supported by high European gas prices as well as restricted Chinese urea and Russian ammonia exports. European gas prices averaged close to $50 per MMBtu in July which equates to an ammonia cash production cost of over $1,700 per tonne. More than 20% of the Europe's ammonia production is estimated to be curtailed, and there are concerns over gas pricing and availability through the winter in Europe."", 'Many buyers have delayed purchases given recent market volatility, and we expect a seasonal resurgence of demand in the second half that could further tighten supply. I will now turn it over to Pedro to review our financial guidance and capital allocation plans.']",management_discussion
3,8,NTR.TO,NTR.TO_607239,2,2022-08-04 14:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q2 2022,2022,392,Pedro Farah,"['Thanks, Ken. First, a few comments on our guidance. We expect a strong second half and a projected adjusted EBITDA in the region of $14 billion to $15.5 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $15.80 to $17.80 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a nearly threefold increase compared to 2021, reflecting both the increase in total earnings and the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding.', 'Retail had a very strong first half, and we are now guiding to adjusted EBITDA between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion in 2022, which represents a 12% annual growth rate over the past 5 years. We expect a more normal fall application season in North America and anticipate per tonne crop nutrient margins below the historically strong levels we achieved in the second half last year.', 'In potash, we narrowed our adjusted EBITDA guidance range and expect record volumes driven by strong demand in offshore markets. Potash prices have been the most stable amongst the 3 primary nutrients and we anticipate that will continue through the second half. Our revised nitrogen earnings guidance range reflects the impact of low North American benchmark pricing and higher than previously forecast domestic natural gas prices.', 'Despite this change, we maintain our constructive outlook for nitrogen markets through the second half of the year and into 2023. We project cash from operating activities of approximately $9.5 billion assuming a cash conversion ratio of 65% at the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance.', 'This ratio is lower than previously forecast due to a change in timing of working capital requirements, However, we expect this to result in a more favorable impact to our operating cash flow in 2023.', 'As Ken mentioned earlier, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation and intend on allocating approximately 1/3 of our operating cash flow to growth in sustained projects. The remaining 2/3 we plan on returning to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, reinvesting [ $1.3 billion ] to [ $1.4 billion ] in sustaining projects to ensure we maintain a safe and reliable operations as well as support our expanding production capability.', 'This is slightly higher than our previous guidance and reflects inflationary pressures on labor and equipment. We believe that inflation and equipment, in particular, may be transitory. We are allocating approximately $1.7 billion to advance high return strategic initiatives across our business that we expect will drive earnings growth through the cycle.', '[ Material ] accounts for nearly 60% of the growth capital with acquisitions and investments focused on expanding our network in core geographies, enhancing our digital capabilities and growing our proprietary products portfolio. We have completed or announced 10 acquisitions so far this year in Brazil, [ the last in ] Australia, for a total investment of approximately $450 million.', 'Following completion of the 2 recent announced acquisitions in Brazil, we expect to surpass our stated target of $100 million of adjusted EBITDA by 2023. Our portfolio of Brazilian acquisitions are performing very well, exceeding our hurdle rate for this market. In potash, the majority of investment is related to underground mine development and additional mining equipment to support the accelerated ramp of our production capability to 18 million tonnes by 2025.', 'This is flexible, low-cost production capability that is unmatched in the industry. And based on what we are seeing in the market is production that will be needed to meet global demand. We estimate a capital cost at $150 to $200 per tonne, providing a very short payback period or in other words, a low [ regret ] cost based on projected margins.', 'We continue to advance our low-cost Phase II nitrogen brownfield expansion projects. And in May, we announced our intention to build a 1.2 million tonne clean ammonia facility at our existing site in Geismar, Louisiana.', 'This project provides an opportunity to leverage existing infrastructure and access to tidewater. We believe this project can achieve attractive returns at mid-cycle ammonia prices, allowed Nutrien to participate in the current and emerging end use markets for merchant ammonia and play a key role in achieving our 2030 emissions reduction goals.', 'To be clear, we are not relying on additional volume or a price premium that may come with the development of a larger clean ammonia market. This will be an upside. Finally, we intend on returning $6 billion in capital to shareholders in 2022, which equates to 13% of our current market cap, around $1 billion of this is our dividend, which was increased by 4.4% back in February.', ""Given the confidence in our operating cash flow, we announced yesterday our intent to complete our existing 10% NCIB in 2022. Completing the NCIB could lower our common shares outstanding to around 500 million by year-end. We plan on factoring in the significant reduction in share count in the decision criteria as we target sustainable and growing dividends over time. And now I'll pass it back to Ken.""]",management_discussion

Look, as you noted, the volatility was much higher in the first half than we had thought. And that impacted our results. As Ken mentioned, we had really good application rates last fall.', 'We had the delayed start to the season. We sure have had some supply constraints. That said, looking forward, the fundamentals remain really strong here. Global demand continues to outstrip global production increases.', ""As you mentioned, the EU gas pricing remains high, leading to challenges there, which we'll keep an eye on is the conversion cost of ammonia into -- sorry, natural gas into ammonia and also ammonium nitrate. And you can see that current pricing capacity starts to get shut in, in Europe."", ""Chinese export reductions remain in place. There are -- I think the only of export of about 750,000 tonnes in the first half. Our outlook is probably going to be around 2 million, 2.5 million  for the full year. That's quite a lot down from normal levels of 3 million to 5 million tonnes."", ""In addition, we're excited about the potential we see in the growth of low carbon.

I think if we look towards the fourth quarter of the year, we have sort of typical seasonal improvement in prices in the forecast as is normally the case, and we expect a constrained and tightened market."", ""That said, relative to the current market conditions, that seasonal increase should be relatively modest. And we certainly don't have included in forecast a return to prices as they were in the first half of the year."", ""But if you look at where natural gas prices are today in Europe and the impact that's having on production shutting down, certainly, marginal cost is even above where prices peaked at the first part of the year.""]",question_answer

Yes, maybe what we'll do is just sort of go around the world. As it relates to inventories that we're seeing and how we're expecting the balance of the year to unfold here. So it is true, yes, that we had, as just mentioned, that strong fall application season in 2021."", 'And then the compressed spring and again, some shift in crop mix in some prevent client area, which led to lower application rates. So coming out of the spring, it is true that we had some carryover volumes on potash in North America.', ""And so therefore, down -- Nutrien down some volumes in that region. Now we just are closing our summer fill program and filling up our Q3 order book at the moment. But we don't expect those North American volumes. We expect a strong fall application season and the backdrop with the ag fundamentals is strong in North America."", ""But at the same time, we don't expect a recovery of those volumes in North America. That said, when we say it's 61 million to 64 million tonnes, we believe it's a supply-constrained world. And again, with the backdrop of the fundamentals, growers in all parts of the world are still incentivized to maximize yield and lay down the appropriate agronomic level of crop nutrients."", ""As you say, in Brazil, imports were up in that part of the world for the first half, and it's really related to -- first of all, the conflict in Ukraine didn't start impacting things until, obviously, after February. So -- and shipments into Brazil were up 30% -- 37% year-over-year, and we're seeing high port inventories."", ""As they prepare for their planting season, we know that those port inventories will be moving inland and are moving inland. We also know that with those port inventories at the moment, they still only have about 50% coverage for their planting season. So we know that the Brazilians will be back in the market buying for their big planting season.\r\nIf we go to China, we know that inventories are significantly down. Their imports were down 11% year-over-year in the first half, and we put port inventories at sort of 1.8 million tonnes. So those are 5-year lows for port inventories, and it's really related to the fact that as the lowest priced market in the world, China is not getting the volumes that it needs. And the same is true for India, which, again, shipments down about [ 37% ] in the first half compared to last year. And inventories in that country are 550,000 to 600,000 tonnes. They're very, very low. And again, just not getting the volume given where pricing is at.\r\nAnd then finally, I'd just say in Southeast Asia, those prices migrated up. We've seen the first half strong on oil prices. And so we saw actually convergence of price for standard, very similar to what granular product were selling for in Brazil. So in other words, strong demand, but we don't believe that Southeast Asia will get the volume they need either this year just due to supply constraints."", ""The last thing I'll say, Jacob, is one of the things we are seeing is for those places that have inventory like North America, albeit due to the delayed spring, like Brazil with some port inventory just a moment.\r\nWe see growers just sort of waiting at these price levels to just-in-time purchasing or last-minute purchasing. Yet again, we know with the strong backdrop of ag fundamentals, we fully expect that they'll be compelled to lay down crop nutrients, but that it will be a supply-constrained market.""]",question_answer

As you know, we move a significant volume of nutrients throughout the year and we're always layering product, and we're starting to fill our sheds now for anticipation of the fall.

And look, actually, I think the story -- when you start looking at tonnage and rates and things like that, I think the story actually it goes further back than just a strong fall of '21. You have to remember that we had 2 record falls from an application rate standpoint, both '20 and '21."", ""I know in my career in this business, I've never seen 2 falls as strong as those 2 back to back. And so when you look at coming into -- and we have an ability in North America. We don't have the same ability in Latin America, Australia. But you have an ability to bank some nutrients with the soil types that we have here in North America."", 'And so when you look at coming into the \'22 planting season, and I think we said and we even forecasted our tonnage would be back in the spring of \'22. But when you look to the fact that you got into a late planting season, and growers -- a lot of these growers had their crops forward contracted. And you got to a point where they said, ""You know what, I\'ve had heavy, heavy applications, particularly from a PNK standpoint the last 2 falls.""\r\n We do soil testing on all this soil, so we kind of know what\'s available there for the crop. They\'ve got an urgency, most of them had an urgency to want to get in and get that crop planted. And then we take it once we got in crop. And we\'ve seen our full year nutritional rates increase this spring quite a bit because of that.', ""So that's one factor as you look at it. The other factor is, is when you look at crop shifts and when I look at crop shifts, I look specifically geographically where those crop shifts take place. And so if you look at corn, where we lost corn to soybeans, we lost that in a big percentage basis in the South. And we have a tremendous retail network in that and a tremendous retail presence in that area."", ""And so when you shift a couple of million acres of corn to soybeans, from a nutritional demand standpoint, that changes significantly. And we came into this season thinking we'd plant somewhere between 92 million and 93 million acres of corn; go by what USDA has today, we're more around 89 million acres of planted corn and stuff."", ""So there's a -- we've listed the factors, but there are multiple factors that were involved. And then once you get in season with it, I'm sure there were some growers that cut some rates back. But they cut their rates back because they felt like they had carryover in the soil."", ""One thing I always point out with growers today is, look, just on the seed, if we take corn, they have $150 an acre investment in the seed and seed treatment. That doesn't include what they have [ in for ]. There are no growers out there that's going to make that kind of commitment to cost on a per acre basis and then come in and say, well, I will greatly reduce my end PNK levels, knowing that's going to affect yield at the end of the day."", ""So our growers are much more sophisticated in that manner. Again, we do a lot of soil testing. It's pretty much our applications to date are based on science. I think you also asked a question around margins, and -- look, we did have tremendous -- while tonnage was down, I think our gross margins on a per tonne basis were up by $68 year-over-year, which was which was amazing."", ""And when I look even deeper into that and I look at the nutritional contribution that our proprietary nutritionals made, they were $38 of our margin this year in the fertilizer shift versus $39 versus $28 a year ago. So again, we had a tremendous step-up with our proprietary nutritionals, that's in the face of the fact that they got -- they went ahead and put the planters in the field. They decided they'd treat crop more in season than maybe in the past."", 'So I feel good about where the nutritionals went out at. I feel good about how growers are making decisions based on that. And every one of them out there in a high commodity price environment are shooting for the top ends of yields.']",question_answer

And if you shift that to soybean, you're shifting it from $50 to $60. So basically, you're cutting the revenue half in 2 when you make those shifts with it."", ""If I look at our seed portfolio, we're very happy where we are through the first half on the seed side of the business. I might add, this past year, there was very little price increase on seed going into the '22 planting season with it. But look, our proprietary business was very strong through the first half.

Before we get into the discussion of our results and outlook for the remainder of 2022, I would like to highlight three key messages."", 'First, we believe structural changes to global energy, agriculture and fertilizer markets will provide a support environment for Nutrien well beyond 2022. Second, we are accelerating strategic growth initiatives that leverage the unique advantages of our integrated business, generate excellent returns on invested capital and enhance our ability to provide sustainable solutions to help feed a growing world.', 'And third, we are committed to a balanced approach to capital allocation that supports growth and the sustainability of our business, while also returning meaningful capital to shareholders. In 2022, we expect to invest around $3 billion on sustaining and growth initiatives and distribute approximately $6 billion in capital to shareholders. Pedro will walk through our plans in more detail later on in this call.', 'Now turning to our results and outlook, Nutrien delivered record first half earnings driven by the strength of market fundamentals, the advantaged position of our global production assets and the excellent performance of retail. We continue to progress our sustainability priorities and had excellent safety performance across the Company, including a strong engagement in our serious injury and fatality prevention efforts, which is the most important work we do.', 'Nutrien Ag Solutions had a record first half with adjusted EBITDA of nearly $1.7 billion, up 38% from the prior year. The retail team delivered higher margins across nearly all products and geographies and supported by the strength of our global supply chain and expanded offering of high-value products and services to growers.', 'Crop nutrient and crop protection margins were very strong due to strategic procurement in a rising price environment and growth in our proprietary nutritional products. North American fertilizer volumes were down in the first half to a combination of a very strong fall season in 2021, some crop mix shifts and a condensed application window this spring.', 'Fertilizer sales volumes outside of North America were up from the prior year, reflecting growth in our Brazilian retail network. Potash adjusted EBITDA increased to $3.4 billion in the first half, supported by higher realized prices and record offshore sales volumes. Potash production increased by more than 5% compared to the first half of 2021, and controllable cash costs were relatively flat.', 'The increase in production reduced our per ton fixed costs and largely offset the impacts of inflation. Spot prices in Brazil and Southeast Asia were up significantly compared to the previous year, and Canpotex continued to prioritize its available volumes to these higher netback offshore markets.', 'In nitrogen, adjusted EBITDA in the first half increased to $2.2 billion as higher realized prices more than offset lower sales volumes and higher natural gas prices. The delayed start of the North American spring season impacted sales volumes, in particular, ammonia and UAN, and was a major contributor to the decline in nitrogen benchmark prices that occurred in the second quarter.', 'We had record phosphate adjusted EBITDA of $423 million in the first half as higher realized prices more than offset the large increase in ammonia and sulfur input costs. In the second quarter, we recognized a non-cash impairment reversal of $450 million, which was driven by improved market fundamentals and a more favorable view of phosphate margins.', 'Turning to the outlook. Global grain and oilseed inventories remain historically low. The recent deal to reopen Ukrainian exports through the Black Sea would be a positive development for global food security, if there is a sustained increase to shipments.', ""However, analysts believe volumes will continue to be challenged by labor and logistical constraints in addition to ongoing military strikes in the region. Ukraine's grain production and export levels are projected to be down dramatically compared to 2021, leaving little buffer for any supply issues in other regions this growing season."", 'U.S. grain conditions were generally favorable. However, high temperatures in July likely capped yield potential and record high temperatures in Europe have reduced summer crop yields. Crop commodity prices have been impacted over the past month by broader market volatility but are still 25% to 35% above the 10-year average, and futures are trading at elevated levels on a multiyear basis.', 'In North America, we expect strong grower demand in the third quarter for top dress nitrogen, special nutritional products and crop protection products. The crop was planted late, but is maturing rapidly with the recent hot weather, and we are planning for a normal application window this fall.', 'In Brazil, grower margins are strong and soybean planted area is expected to increase by 2% to 4%. Fertilizer inventories have been slow to move from core to inland positions as buyers look to purchase on a just-in-time basis. But we anticipate strong movements over the next two months to ensure product is available for the upcoming planting season.', 'In potash, much of the focus remains on supply challenges in Eastern Europe. Shipments from Russia and Belarus were down an estimated 25% and 50%, respectively, in the first half of 2022. Russian potash is not currently sanctioned, but has been impacted by restrictions on financing activities that facilitate exports.', 'The impact of sanctions on Belarus supply has been more significant due to the loss of access to Tidewater through Lithuania. Belarus is reportedly shipping small volumes via container, which for a bulk commodity is a more costly and logistically challenging option.', 'We narrowed our global potash shipment forecast to between 61 million and 64 million tons in 2022 and expect shipments to be constrained by restrictions on exports from Russia and Belarus. Beyond the existing supply challenges, we see the potential for delays in the development of new potash capacity from this region, which was projected to be the source of approximately 60% of new potash supply, excluding Nutrien, over the next five years. We expect nitrogen prices to strengthen in the second half supported by high European gas prices as well as restricted Chinese urea and Russian ammonia exports.', ""European gas prices averaged close to $50 per MMBtu in July which equates to an ammonia cash production cost of over $1,700 per ton more than 20% of the Europe's ammonia production is estimated to be curtailed, and there are concerns over gas pricing and availability through the winter in Europe. Many buyers have delayed purchases given recent market volatility, and we paid by seasonal resurgence of then in the second half that could further tighten supply."", 'I will now turn it over to Pedro to review our financial guidance and capital allocation plans.']",management_discussion

First, a few comments on our guidance, we expect a strong second half and the projected adjusted EBITDA in the region of $14 billion to $15.5 billion and adjusted EPS in the range of $15.8 to $17.8 per share. The midpoint of our adjusted EPS guidance represents a nearly threefold increase compared to 2021, reflecting both the increase in total earnings and the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding.', 'Retail had a very strong first half, and we are now guiding to adjusted EBITDA between $2.1 billion and $2.2 billion in 2022, which represents a 12% annual growth rate over the past five years. We expect a more normal fall application season in North America and anticipate per ton crop nutrient margins below this historically strong levels we achieved in the second half last year.', 'In potash, we narrowed our adjusted EBITDA guidance range and expect record volumes driven by strong demand in offshore markets. Potash prices have been the most stable amongst the three primary nutrients and we anticipate that will continue through the second half. Our revised nitrogen earnings guidance range reflects the impact of low North American benchmark pricing and higher than previously forecast domestic natural gas prices.', 'Despite this change, we maintain our constructive outlook for nitrogen markets through the second half of the year and into 2023. We project cash from operating activities of approximately $9.5 billion assuming a cash conversion ratio of 65% at the midpoint of our adjusted EBITDA guidance.', 'This ratio is lower than previously forecast due to a change in timing of working capital requirements; however, we expect this to result in a more favorable impact to our operating cash flow in 2023. As Ken mentioned earlier, we have a balanced approach to capital allocation and intend on allocating approximately 1/3 of our operating cash flow to growth in sustained projects.', 'he remaining 2/3 we plan on returning to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. Reinvesting 1.3 to 1.4 in sustaining projects to ensure we maintain a safe and reliable operations, as well as support our expanding production capability.', 'This is slightly higher than our previous guidance and reflects inflationary pressures on labor and equipment. We believe that inflation and equipment, in particular, may be transitory. We are allocating approximately $1.7 billion to advance high return strategic initiatives across our business that we expect will drive earnings growth through the cycle.', 'Critical accounts for nearly 60% of the growth capital with acquisitions and investments focused on expanding our network in core geographies enhancing our digital capabilities and growing our proprietary products portfolio. We have completed or announced 10 acquisitions so far this year in Brazil, last in Australia, for a total investment of approximately $450 million.', 'Following completion of the two recent announced acquisitions in Brazil, we expect to surpass our stated target of $100 million of adjusted EBITDA by 2023. Our portfolio of Brazilian acquisitions are performing very well, exceeding our hurdle rate for this market. In potash, the majority of investment is related to underground mine development and additional mining equipment to support the accelerated ramp of our production capability to 18 million tons by 2025.', 'This is flexible, low-cost production capability that is unmatched in the industry. And based on what we are seeing in the market is production that will be needed to meet global demand. We estimate a capital cost at $150 to $200 per ton, providing a very short payback period or in other words, a low regret cost based on projected margins.', 'We continue to advance our low-cost Phase II nitrogen brownfield expansion projects. And in May, we announced our intention to build a 1.2 million ton clean ammonia facility at our existing site in Geismar, Louisiana.', 'This project provides an opportunity to leverage existing infrastructure and access to tidewater. We believe this project can achieve attractive returns at mid-cycle ammonia prices, allowed Nutrien to participate in the current and emerging end use markets for merchant ammonia and play a key role in achieving our 2030 emissions reduction goals.', 'To be clear, we are not relying on additional volume or a price premium that may come with the development of a larger clean ammonia market. This will be an upside. Finally, we intend on returning $6 billion in capital to shareholders in 2022, which equates to 13% of our current market cap, around $1 billion of this is our dividend, which was increased by 4.4% back in February.', 'Given the confidence in our operating cash flow, we announced yesterday our intent to complete our existing 10% NCIB in 2022. Completing the NCIB to lower our common shares outstanding to around $500 million by year-end, we plan on factoring in the significant reduction in share count in the decision criteria as we target sustainable and growing dividends over time.', ""And now I'll pass it back to Ken.""]",management_discussion

We expect a strong fall application season and the backdrop with the ag fundamentals is strong in North America."", ""But at the same time, we don't expect a recovery of those volumes in North America.

So -- and shipments into Brazil were up 30% -- 37% year-over-year, and we're seeing high port inventories as they prepare for their planting season, we know that those port inventories will be moving in land and are moving in land. And we also know that with those port inventories at the moment, they still only have about 50% coverage for their planting season. So we know that the Brazilians will be back in the market buying for their big planting season."", ""If we go to China, we know that inventories are significantly down. Their imports were down 11% year-over-year in the first half, and we put port inventories at sort of 1.8 million tons. So those are five-year lows for port inventories, and it's really related to the fact that as the lowest priced market in the world, China or not getting the volumes that it needs. And the same is true for India, which, again, shipments down about 37% in the first half compared to last year. And inventories in that country are 550,000, 600,000 tons. They're very, very low, and again, just not getting the volume given where pricing is that."", ""And then finally, I'd just say in Southeast Asia, those prices migrated up. We've seen the first half strong on oil prices. And so we saw actually convergence of price for standard a bit similar to what granular product we're selling for in Brazil.

We see growers just sort of waiting at these price levels to just-in-time purchasing or last-minute purchasing.

As you know, we move a significant volume of nutrients throughout the year and we're always layering product and we're starting to fill our sheds now or in anticipation of the fall.

You have to remember that we had two record falls from an application rate standpoint, both '20 and '21."", ""I know in my career in this business, I've never seen two falls as strong as those two back to back. And so, when you look at coming into -- and we have an ability in North America, we don't have the same ability in Latin America, Australia. But you have an ability to bank some nutrients with the soil types that we have here in North America."", 'And so when you look at coming into the \'22 planning season, and I think we said and we even forecasted our tonnage will be back in the spring of \'22. But when you look to the fact that you got into a late planting season, and growers -- a lot of these growers had their crops forward contracted. And you got to a point where they said, ""You know what, I\'ve had heavy, heavy applications, particularly from a PNK standpoint the last two falls.""', ""We do soil testing on all this soil, so we kind of know what's available there for the crop. They got urgency, and most of them had an urgency the one -- to get in and get that crop planted. And then we take it once we had in crop. And we've seen our full year nutritional rates increase this spring quite a bit because of that."", ""So that's one factor as you look at it. The other factor is, is when you look at crop shifts and when I look at crop shifts, I look specifically geographically where those crops take place. And so, if you look at corn, where we lost corn to soybeans, we lost that in a big percentage basis in the South, and we have a tremendous retail network in that and a tremendous retail presence in that area."", ""And so you ship a couple of million acres of corn to soybeans, from a nutritional demand standpoint, that changes significantly. And we came into this season thinking we plant somewhere between 92 million and 93 million acres of corn, go by what USDA has today, we're more around 89 million acres of planted corn and stuff."", ""So there's a -- we've listed the factors, but there are multiple factors that were involved. And then once you get in season, with it, I'm sure there were some growers, they cut some rates back. But they cut the rates back because they felt like they had carryover in soil."", ""One thing I always point out with growers today is, look, just on the seed, if we take corn, they have $150 an acre investment in the seed and seed treatment. That is including what they have in for. There are no growers out there that's going to make that kind of commitment to cost on a per acre basis and then come in and say, well, I will greatly reduce my end PNK levels, no one that's going to affect yield at the end of the day."", ""So our growers much more sophisticated in that manner but we do a lot of soil testing. It's a pretty much our applications to-date are based on science. I think you also asked a question around margins, and look, we did have tremendous -- while tonnage was down, I think our gross margins on a per ton basis were up by $68 year-over-year, which was which was amazing."", ""And when I look even deeper into that and I look at the nutritional contribution that our proprietary nutritionals made, they were $38 of our margin this year in the fertilizer ship versus $39 versus $28 a year ago. So again, we had a tremendous step-up with our proprietary nutritionals, that's in the face of the fact that they got -- they went ahead and put the planters in the field. They decided they treat crop more in season than maybe in the past."", 'So I feel good about where the nutrients went out at. I feel good about how growers are making decisions based on that. And every one of them out there in a high commodity price environment or shooting for top ends of yields.']",question_answer

And -- yes, we're just -- I think as everyone is watching inventories in those parts of the world, and -- it is true that certainly in a place like India we're seeing demand rationing, where potash is simply not going to ground based on availability. So it's not sort of traditional potash application rates dwindling the inventories in country."", ""So that said, in a place like India, as I mentioned earlier, it's only 550,000 tons sitting on the ground in that country. So very close to zero. So it's hard to say exactly when India will be back in the market. But if we say that there will be some reasonable nutrients going to ground, and we provided those nutrients in the deck that we provided for this call, well then, you would expect that sometime this fall and maybe later fall, India would be back talking about the new contract."", ""And then thirdly, with China, where again, port inventories, it's sort of a five-year loan. And when we say 1.7 million tons sitting at port, we called it 1.5 million of that is the so-called strategic reserve. So very low inventories in China, and we do expect that China will lay down some volumes as well in this fall season."", ""So like, India, again, we expect it's a 2022 event where they'll have to come have some discussions about new volumes at a new price. What that price will be in those contract markets? It's a great question, Steve."", ""If we go around the world and we see where are standard grade markets trading today, we've seen Southeast Asia trade up to $1,000 a ton now that's moderated somewhat, but standard grade, those are some of the biggest standard grade markets in the world trading at those levels. I expect, therefore, that the China and Indian contracts will have to come up significantly.""]",question_answer

And look, when you look at it from a revenue basis and again, when you have crop shifts, so if you look at corn, an acre, again, I said anywhere from $125 to $150 an acre when you sell in corn seed. And you shift that to soybean, you're shifting it from $50 to $60. So basically, you're cutting the revenue half in two when you make those shifts with it."", ""If I look at our seed portfolio, we're very happy where we are through the first half on the seed side of the business. I might add, this past year, very little price increase on seed going into the '22 planning season with it. But look, our proprietary business was very strong through the first half. We grew a seed margins by 30% on our proprietary business."", ""We were up on revenue and margins really across all regions as it relates to the seed portfolio. And we've got an awful lot of momentum going in. Believe it or not, we've started our fall seed campaign here in the last week. And so -- we've got a lot of momentum going into that."", ""Now you talked about seed pricing going forward. And I think that we'll see most of our seats supplier I maybe missed that window last year to raise prices. I think we'll see something significantly different going into the '23 season. I think canola was probably likely going to be up 5% to 10%, corn could be up as high as 10% pricing going into '23, and indication that soybeans will be up from 8% to 10% going into '23."", ""So we're going to see a rise in seed costs going into this new crop year. We were particularly strong on our Dyna-Gro across our cotton, soybean and rice portfolio. And rice, this was an introductory year but Dyna-Gro 263, which we've had a tremendous amount of success in getting that in as well.

So that's a pretty significant number. And then, with Belarus still not having access to tidewater via Lithuania, we estimate that their first half shipments are down 50%."", ""So, really quite significant out of that part of the world. And again, recalling that shipments out of Russia at least weren't constrained in the first two months of this year. As we look forward, what -- for the balance of 2022 and into 2023, what might that look like? And, yes, for 2022, again, we expect the Russian shipments could be constrained by up as much as that 25% full year."", ""And then similarly with Belarus for 2022, we expect exports could be constrained by 50% to 65% compared to 2021 level.

It's just that financing activities and those segments are making it somewhat difficult at the moment. But for 2023, coming out of Russia, we think that production might be down in the range of, say, 5% to 20% from 2021 levels."", ""And then out of Belarus, again, much more significant because of these challenges getting to port. And out of Belarus, our assumption for 2023 is maybe 30% to 50% of production down from 2021 levels.

So actually, the volumes are relatively small, but even for 2 million tons, that's 80,000 containers of potash. And at the load port those you need to tip up a container and stuff them full of potash, and even more challenging at the discharge port, they need to be equipped to tip those containers and empty of them."", ""So I think it remains to be seen how successful that will be. But even if they're fully successful, it's only 2 million to 3 million tons, which, by the way, they have to do in order to meet at the bottom end of our range. So that's at least how at the moment, we're seeing things unfold and, hence, our view that the fundamentals for potash are going to remain strong right through 2022, right through 2023, and then it's going to be a supply-constrained market.""]",question_answer
