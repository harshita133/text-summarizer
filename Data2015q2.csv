On the phone with us today is Mr. Chuck Magro, President and CEO of Agrium; Mr. Steve Douglas, our CFO; and our entire executive management team to review and discuss our results."", 'As we conduct this conference call, various statements that we make about future expectations, plans and prospects contain forward-looking information. Certain material assumptions were applied in making these conclusions and forecasts. Therefore, actual results could differ materially from those contained in our forward-looking information. Additional information about these factors and assumptions are contained in our current quarterly report to our shareholders, as well as our most recent annual report, MD&A, and annual information Form filed with Canadian and U.S. Securities Commissions to which we direct you.', 'I will now turn the call over to Mr. Chuck Magro.']",management_discussion,NTR.TO_88495,73,NTR.TO,2,2015-08-06 20:28:08,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015
2,4208,Charles V. Magro,"[""Thanks, Richard, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to Agrium's second quarter earnings call. Agrium delivered strong results this quarter. One underlying factor behind this performance was our continued focus on making Operational Excellence core to everything we do. The strength of our Wholesale sales and operating performance this quarter is just one illustration of its ongoing value."", ""Agrium's EBITDA was up 10% over last year in spite of significant weather and market-related headwinds. These results were made possible by the strength of our competitive advantages across our product portfolio, the diversity of our products and our geographic reach. Our Wholesale operations delivered higher production volumes and stronger margins, even in a lower fertilizer pricing demand environment. Our Retail Distribution segment performed well in the U.S. and Australia despite tough market and weather conditions. The major variance in Retail earnings from last year was Western Canada where severe drought and currency impacted results."", 'A highlight for our Wholesale operational performance was the 35% increase in nitrogen sales tonnes over the prior year. This was made possible by strong facility utilization rates, again, this quarter. In fact, the first half of 2015 delivered the highest total production level since the year 2000 for our ammonia facilities, and they operated at our target 90% utilization rate for this period. This was supported by excellent performance from our Wholesale marketing and sales group and by optimizing our Retail Distribution channel.', ""The higher volumes and lower gas cost also contributed to lower per tonne costs. Altogether, this resulted in our nitrogen gross margins reaching $220 a tonne or almost double last year's levels. Potash production and sales volume are on track to meet our target, as we continue to ramp up our expansion of Vanscoy. We surpassed our target of 700,000 tonnes for the first half, and we are maintaining our estimate of 2.1 million tonnes for 2015. We have seen our potash cash cost of production decline to $110 a tonne this quarter, and we expect a further reduction in the second half of the year."", 'Phosphate results remain strong, with margins of just over $100 a tonne and gross profit of $29 million achieved despite conducting plant turnarounds at both sites in June. The Retail Distribution business faced three major headwinds this spring; adverse weather conditions, lower sentiment and currency. Weather conditions across North America were challenging, with record amounts of moisture across most of the Corn Belt and Southeast U.S in June, and a serious drought in Western Canada. The drought reduced demand for crop inputs and services in Canada. The wet weather in the Corn Belt prevented growers from accessing their fields to sidedress nitrogen and apply crop protection products, and also prevented some soybean acres from getting planted in the southern states.', ""In California, the ongoing drought removed at least 700,000 acres from production. Despite this, our California business is performing well due to strong demand for permanent crops and higher value fruits and vegetables. Grower sentiment was impacted by lower crop price environment, which led to a shift in seeded acreage, influenced growers' purchases and compressed seed margins. We also saw an acreage shift away from some input-intensive crops, such as corn, cotton and canola towards less intensive crops such as soybeans and sorghum."", 'Despite these factors, our market intelligence indicates our U.S. Retail Distribution operations performed significantly better than our peers. One example of this was the prevailing sentiment at the recent Southwest Fertilizer Conference that U.S. nutrient demand was down this spring compared to last year. Comparatively, our U.S. Retail business achieved a 3% increase in nutrient sales volume. Despite these conditions, we held our nutrient margins to similar levels to last year in the U.S., with margins at $107 a tonne this quarter compared to $111 per tonne for the same quarter last year.', 'In crop protection, we delivered impressive results under tough market conditions. We achieved higher year-over-year margins, sales volumes and gross profit in North America this quarter. This was largely attributed to continued growth of our Loveland proprietary products line, which saw a 10% increase in sales this quarter and represented 23% of our total crop protection sales.', 'The seed market was the most heavily impacted by lower crop prices. And the shift in crop acreage this year to lower valued crops, as well as some trading-down of seed traits. We increased sales of our proprietary seed lines year-over-year, which supported our seed margins and again demonstrates the importance of our proprietary products strategy.', 'In total, our retail metric fell short of targets this quarter, but we are focused on implementing a variety of Operational Excellence initiatives to ensure we continue to make solid progress towards them in the future. While our normalized comparable store sales were down 1% year-over-year, we believe that we outperformed the market as we estimate total North American crop expenditures were down approximately 5%, largely due to changes in crop acreage.', 'Moving from our results to our expansion projects, we mentioned we have kept our annual potash production target at 2.1 million tonnes and our Canpotex proving run remains scheduled to start in the second half of this year. And I also want to provide an important update on our border expansion project that we have made changes to its scope. Our original scope encompass a refresh and expansion to the existing ammonia plant and the building of a new 610,000 tonne urea facility.', ""After careful consideration, we've made the decision to reduce the scope in order to de-risk the project to manage project cost pressures and ensure the highest possible returns. In this regard, we will finish building the new urea plant and refresh the existing ammonia facility to improve on-stream time and to ensure continued operation of the Borger facility, which is our oldest nitrogen plant. However, we have decided not to expand the existing ammonia plant given the high cost and the significantly longer downtime required to complete this portion of the project than was originally planned."", 'In effect, the economic returns on 145,000-tonne debottleneck do not justify the cost or risk of this component of the project. The project CapEx remains within 5% of the original $720 million estimate. We anticipate the completion of the ammonia facility refresh in the first quarter of 2016, and to have the urea plant mechanically complete by the end of 2016. The IRR for the project is expected to still be in the double-digits, and the scope change is not expected to have a material impact on our future earnings. We believe the revised project plan is the best option to preserve returns and to manage the risk going forward.', 'I would like to turn over the call now to Steve Douglas to review our key financial metrics.']",management_discussion,NTR.TO_88495,73,NTR.TO,2,2015-08-06 20:28:08,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015
3,4209,Steven J. Douglas,"[""Thank you, Chuck, and good morning, everybody. Agrium's results this quarter were strong with adjusted earnings at $4.90 per share, bringing our first half adjusted earnings to $5.01 per share, which is right in the middle of our guidance range. We also grew our earnings over last year in spite of a more challenging market condition, which shows the unique strength of our business model."", ""We are committed to ensuring we deliver on our capital allocation vision and strategy, and as Chuck just discussed, we're willing to make difficult decisions if projects are not meeting return expectations. We expect our total capital expenditures to come in at our previous range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion for 2015, and $800 million to $900 million in 2016."", 'We continue to execute on our existing share buyback program, and repurchased approximately 1 million shares since the end of March. We also expect to be active on our share buyback program through the second half of this year.', 'Our financial capacity and flexibility is derived from our strategic competitive strengths, which underpin our strong cash flow generation and our balance sheet position. In this regard, we have $2.2 billion of undrawn lines of credit and over $640 million of cash on hand.', 'Our net debt-to-EBITDA is 2.5 times on a rolling-four quarters basis, well within our targeted comfort zone. This ratio has remained steady over the last three quarters and is expected to decline as we move into next year. The average interest on our long-term debt is 5% and we have less than $700 million maturing in the next five years.', ""I am pleased to report we already exceeded the $475 million target that we've set for our Operational Excellence program, well ahead of our 2017 target timeline, which includes $350 million of one-time cash realization initiatives and $125 million of recurring EBITDA improvement. The one-time cash realizations have been achieved primarily through our portfolio review and reductions in our working capital."", ""Recurring EBITDA improvements have been driven by logistics and procurement efficiencies, lower operating costs and reductions in G&A costs over 25% since 2013. We will continue to set aggressive goals in this area in order to build upon the momentum we've achieved to-date."", 'The new Alberta government recently announced an increase to the corporate tax rate from 10% to 12%. The impact to Agrium in the second quarter this year was $21 million. The majority of which was a one-time adjustment on a non-cash basis to a deferred tax liability on our balance sheet. As a result, our 2015 effective tax rate will move from approximately 27% to 29%, and expect that after 2015 the effective tax rate will be somewhere around 28%.', ""We've provided updated 2015 annual guidance for earnings of $7 to $7.50 per share. We believe nutrient prices are at or near floor price levels, that our costs will remain low and our plant utilization rates will remain strong. However, we did move significant wholesale volumes in this quarter, which resulted in lower ending inventories in June across all nutrients. We anticipate second-half retail earnings will be similar to levels achieved over the past few years."", 'I want to emphasize that our free cash flow message remains intact. We generated over $4 per share of free cash flow in the first half of 2015. We are still on target to meet our objectives, remain committed to both expanding capital returns to shareholders and to continue to grow the business. It is possible due to our stable, yet growing earnings profile, our continued focus on OpEx and the strength in our balance sheet.', 'With that, I will turn it back to Chuck for his thoughts on our outlook.']",management_discussion,NTR.TO_88495,73,NTR.TO,2,2015-08-06 20:28:08,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015
4,4210,Charles V. Magro,"['Thanks, Steve. Turning to the market outlook. The wet weather in the U.S. Corn Belt reduced yield potential such that record yields are unlikely to be attained this year. However, the excess moisture came after most crops had been seeded and emerged and too much rain on its own rarely has a dramatic impact on average U.S. yields. We are still cautiously optimistic for the second half, as we see nutrient prices already near floor price levels and expect our operations to continue to achieve low cost of production.', 'The excess rain in the U.S. this year has likely contributed to nitrogen loss in soil, which will support nitrogen applications this fall. One variable we are monitoring is moisture levels in Western Canadian soils as growers in this region will need additional moisture in order to apply normal levels of fall ammonia.', ""Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to welcome Harry Deans who will be officially starting at Agrium in less than two weeks to assume the role of Wholesale President. Harry comes to us from the INEOS Group in Switzerland where he was most recently CEO of INEOS Nitriles. Harry has over two decades of experience, managing petrochemical and commodity businesses, as well as significant large project expertise, and we're excited to have him join our team. Ron Wilkinson will remain at Agrium as a special advisor to the CEO."", ""I would like to finish our comments this morning by reinforcing that Agrium's strategy, our competitive advantages across our product lines, growing free cash flow and clearly articulated capital allocation plans make for a positive outlook for the company. As Steve Douglas has just mentioned, we generated over $4 per share of free cash flow in the first six months of the year, which is up 15% from a year ago and illustrates our cash flow generation potential even in a lackluster market environment."", 'Our free cash flow is expected to grow, as our potash expansion continues to ramp up, as we grow retail and we recognize increasing benefits from our focus on Operational Excellence. Our unique business model sets us apart from our peers and we are confident it will generate excellent returns for our shareholders.', ""With that, I'd like to open the call up for questions.""]",management_discussion,NTR.TO_88495,73,NTR.TO,2,2015-08-06 20:28:08,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

6,4212,Ben Isaacson,"[""Thank you very much. Just one question. When I take a look at your commentary about drought in Western Canada or California and wet weather in the Corn Belt, it kind of raises the question about what is normal weather. And as we saw this quarter, that does have an impact to your business in terms of pricing and margins. So without opening up a climate change debate, I mean, is this a trend that you're seeing or is it the risk that needs to be managed over the next kind of four, five years or so?""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_88495,73,NTR.TO,2,2015-08-06 20:28:08,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015
7,4213,Charles V. Magro,"[""Yeah. It's a great question, Ben. Look, we're not in the business of forecasting weather, of course. But what I can tell you is, we do expect that you're going to – we're going to have challenges every year when it comes to the growing conditions. And if you look at the Retail business model specifically, that's why we're on so many different crops and so many regions around the world is to diversify our portfolio. And when you look at our overall results ,even though you never want to see retail numbers head downwards, when you step back and you look at retail's overall performance, in a pretty tough market conditions with really difficult weather, you look at that and say the Retail business has actually performed exceptionally well."", ""I mentioned comments on my prepared remarks with the Southwest Fertilizer Conference, we're hearing retailers that are regionally based being down 20% or more in certain regions. The seed and chemical guys were down over 10% and yet we did have a major drought in Western Canada, which really hurt the Western Canadian business. But the Australia business, from an EBITDA perspective, was up. Our U.S. business was down only modestly, about 3%, I believe, year-over-year. So when you look at that, I think that we are going to continue to see weather challenges and that's why our strategy of being large and diversified, I think, add so much value.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_88495,73,NTR.TO,2,2015-08-06 20:28:08,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

9,4215,Andrew D. Wong,"[""Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. So – I mean, this is probably a little bit too early right now, but with farmers coming back on spending this year, if we enter next year with a similar dynamic in the ag markets with crop prices where they are, would you expect a similar response from farmers and continued challenges on pricing and margin? And then, just kind of on top of that, with the cut-back in crop inputs, chemicals, seed, fertilizers, can we expect to see any impact on yields with the lower spending, and if we don't, what does that tell us about the value add from the crop inputs side of things?""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_88495,73,NTR.TO,2,2015-08-06 20:28:08,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

11,4217,Stephen G. Dyer,"[""Hi, Andrew. Yeah. In terms of the overall farmer sentiment, we see commodity prices on corn and soybean in particular around where they are today. Yeah, we'll see similar kind of pressure that we've seen this year into next year. If you look at overall farm spending, and it's still fairly strong. Again, what we've seen is that we have seen some margin pressure; we've also seen some pressure particularly on seed around the trade-down of quality of seed, that type of things as well. But what we'd also see for us as a big strength is our proprietary products."", ""Again, our proprietary products are up. If you look at on the chemistry side, we're up from year-to-date 20% of our sales to 23% of our sales. And on the seed side, we're from 22.5% to 23.5%.

Yes, we have had some – a bit of margin pressure there, but overall we're fairly flat to last year even on the bottom-line performance.

And when we simply looked at the smaller part of the project, which was the expansion of the ammonia plant, when you look at that, it's a 40-year-old plant. By the time we finished the detailed engineering and then the outage planning, it became really evident that the capital costs and the downtime to get that 145,000 tonnes while sort of doing open-heart surgery on a 40-year old ammonia plant, the risk profile and the return profile didn't make sense."", ""So it's a tough decision. It's absolutely the right decision. The current scope that we have now de-risk the project very significantly.

And it is also assuming that we do get a little bit more moisture in Western Canada, which we actually did get this week, and have more of a normal fall application season for ammonia.

We appreciate this opportunity to discuss our second quarter performance and to share our thoughts on what we see ahead. We also know many of you are interested in update on our proposal to K+S. So we will touch on that as well today. We will remind you that we have not made a formal offer, and we only confirmed our private proposal after it became known to the media. I will be as fulsome (02:47) as possible given these facts, and with that approach, would kind ask that today's Q&A session remain focused on our business and market conditions."", 'Our second quarter earnings of $0.50 per share hit the midpoint of our guidance range, although results of both the quarter and first six months each trails their respective periods last year, primarily due to weaker nitrogen earnings.', ""In Potash, we generated $417 million in gross margin, exceeding last year's second quarter total. This reflected weaker demand in North America that was more than offset by strong shipments to offshore markets. Canpotex shipped record volumes in the second quarter and through the first half as improved Canadian rail logistics and enhanced infrastructure and distribution capabilities helped them better meet customer demands."", ""In our Nitrogen business, our gross margin declined 27% to $222 million relative to last year's second quarter as weaker global demand and increased supply led to lower prices for our products. Improved phosphate markets and the greater focus on higher netback, less volatile feed, industrial and liquid fertilizers supported improved margins during the quarter. Higher prices for these products along with the absence of Suwannee River closure costs more than offset lower sales volumes and raised gross margin to $72 million, far surpassing last year's total."", ""Importantly, we continue to make great strides from a safety standpoint. Our total site recordable injury rate for the first half of the year was 24% lower than the same timeframe in 2014. We're on track to improve upon last year's annual record and toward our goal of being one of the safest resource companies in the world."", 'From an operational point, we took some important steps as well. We achieved a significant project milestone at Rocanville this quarter. Our new shaft at Scissors Creek broke through into the underground mine workings in late June. Our employees accomplished a great feat; in fact it is the first time it has been done in Saskatchewan since 1978, when a service shaft was completed in Lanigan.', 'Like any large-scale projects, there are challenges along the way, but we are working to the final phases of our expansion plans that will see us meaningfully enhance capability at this low cost operation. Our next step will involve installing new hoisting units and readying up for ramp up.', ""In New Brunswick, we continue to advance development of our new Picadilly mine as planned. We're continuing to operate our Penobsquis mine to supplement production during the ramp up of Picadilly to ensure we can meet customer needs. This asset is uniquely positioned to serve the Brazilian market and fulfill Heringer's growing needs in the years ahead, as well as our other customers in Latin America and other locals."", 'As we look ahead, we do so with long-term confidence, but a somewhat tempered near-term view. Uncertain economic growth prospects in many developing markets have resulted in increased volatility in equity and currency markets around the globe. In this environment, prices for most commodities have weakened, and while fertilizer has weathered the storm better than many, it has not been immune. While these conditions act as headwind, we also see encouraging signs that support our long-term value proposition. Importantly, encouraging potash consumption trends continue to unfold, especially in markets like China and India. The rising demand for higher potassium content bulk blends and compound fertilizers in these regions is keeping global demand at elevated levels even as customer markets like the U.S. take a more cautious approach on the market.', 'We see global potash volumes remaining relatively robust through the balance of the year. A strong base load of committed tonnage to contract markets, as well as an acceleration of purchasing activity through the third quarter in Brazil is expected to see global shipments approximately 60 million tonnes in 2015, at the high end of our previous guidance range. While these demand trends are encouraging and have kept our annual potash sales volumes estimates largely unchanged, we have lowered our full-year expectations for potash gross margin given the declining prices through the second quarter.', ""Increased supply and ongoing competitive pressure have created headwinds most visible in spot markets like the U.S. where prices have fallen by more than 10% since the beginning of the year. These market dynamics impact all potash producers, but relative to many peers, we believe we're advantaged in our ability to manage and succeed in this or any environment. We have unmatched flexibility to capture growth in a robust demand environment and strategies to mitigate down risk in a more challenging environment."", 'In our Nitrogen and Phosphate businesses, we expect the market dynamics of the second quarter to persist through the balance of 2015, and have maintained our annual combined gross margin guidance range. To reflect a slightly more cautious view on Potash through the final six months, we have lowered the upper end of our previous guidance range with our expectations for 2015 now at $1.75 to $1.95 per share.', ""Before we turn the call over to questions, I'd like to make a few comments about our proposal we made to K+S. Our proposed business combination would provide enhanced diversification offering a spectrum of products including potash, specialty products like SOP, salt, phosphate and nitrogen from geographically diverse production locations. The combined company would be well positioned to serve marketplaces throughout the world and further expand into emerging markets like Africa. We believe the combination would enhance the breadth of each company's respective portfolio, improve cash flow capabilities and provide a more stable and secure operating environment. Our two companies bring together complementary assets with minimal overlap of operations in markets."", ""With respect to legacy, we would be committed to completing the current capital build out and making it operational. Production from this operation would be managed as part of our Saskatchewan portfolio consistent with our current strategy. While we would have to discuss the matter with Canpotex's other members, we would expect to export legacy product offshore through Canpotex and capitalize on its world-class global distribution platform of railcars, warehouses and port facilities."", ""Further, with PotashCorp's own infrastructure already available within North America, we have an important and readily available distribution network in the domestic market. In short, this combination would create a more efficient integrated company able to prosper in an increasingly competitive global marketplace, with expanding global capacity."", ""There are three stakeholder groups that I would like to address specifically in the context of this proposal. First, our shareholders. You can be assured in this proposal or any other business opportunity we consider that we will remain financially disciplined. Importantly, we're confident that our transaction would not be at the expense of either our dividend or our investment credit rating."", ""Second, K+S's shareholders, we are fair. We believe our €41 per share proposal, which is subject to due diligence, provides full and fair value. It represents a 57% premium relative to the 12-month average stock price prior to the proposal and a premium significantly above other comparable transactions. Finally, K+S's employees and communities, we're confident our combination will create benefits for these stakeholders as well."", ""In fact, we believe a combination provides greater stability and more opportunities for career growth, just as it would for our own employees. Because of the compelling strategic benefits, our proposal is not predicated on job cuts, mine closures or selling the salt business. Our plan would be to operate the German potash mines and salt business in the same manner as K+S, uphold existing environmental obligations, preserve the K+S brand and maintain K+S's headquarters in Kassel as European headquarters. To that regard, we are prepared to make binding commitments that provide these assurances."", ""We are continuing to seek a constructive dialogue with K+S to pursue a friendly transaction. As I mentioned earlier, we do not intend to comment further on our proposal for K+S at this time. We ask that our question session be focused on our earnings and business conditions, and we'll be happy to take any questions now.

Yes, China remains strong, in fact, to the point where we do anticipate a record year of imports and shipments. I think one of the things that is paying off now for us is really the Canpotex strategy of affiliating with other producers of NPK fertilizers. There is a growing demand, as I said in my remarks, on compounds and specialty fertilizers, and that's really fueling a true demand in China, and we're seeing that. A macro environment has an impact. There is no question in general on the economy, but we have not seen that specifically in the fertilizer business or in the demand for fertilizer. So, we really think it is a true demand for consumptions."", ""To your points on anything more specific in inventory, really to the extent that we have visibility, we don't see a particular build up in inventory.

89,4295,Stephen F. Dowdle,"[""Good morning. I believe one of the drivers that we're seeing in China, as we note, we do expect demand to continue to expand this year in China. There is really a drive for improved efficiencies there, and we see this – the economy is still expanding albeit at a slower rate. And we're seeing cash – high value cash crops in demand, and that's part of the growth behind the NPK's and the bulk blends. And we're also in terms of efficiencies seeing that these compound fertilizers are more efficient in their application across all of China, and that's helping fuel the potash growth story this year."", ""As far as the subsidies are concerned, there's been a lot of talk about revamping the corn, particularly corn. There's been an expectation that there's going to be a change in policy. Right now it's only at the rumor stage, but what could happen if subsidies were changed and the policies were changed, that we would see corn imports grow into China. And it would also further support the need for whatever corn and soybean acres are being cultivated that the drive to improve yields on those acres will be accelerated, which will also be positive for potash growth."", ""And maybe one more point really is the impact of the policy to keep nitrogen phosphate applications flat by 2020, and that's really – it's good news for potash, because it does call for more sophisticated application, and we see that as a benefit as well.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_87212,74,NTR.TO,2,2015-07-30 20:44:05,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

92,4298,Jochen E. Tilk,"[""Yeah, I'll just give you a couple of numbers and then again my colleague Stephen can get into it more. So the general estimate on past imports has been approximately 0.8 million, 800,000 tonnes, and I think the current estimates for imports now for the year is 1.3 million, so about a half a million more than what the average would be, but still below record years. And the points of entry would be New Orleans barges, it would be some extent Tampa. So those would be the entry points for offshore. And the amount of imports as it has increased obviously provided greater availability and a more competitive environment in the United States. So, dynamic is not surprising. It did have an impact."", ""On the other hand, I mean we think, as I said as well, that we were able to compete with that because what's missing is you still have to get it from the barge to the customers. You still have to get it from Tampa to the customers, so there is distribution networks, there is warehouses, and all these things involved, and we have seen perhaps more than ever in the last six months that that provides a competitive advantage in this specific environment."", 'Stephen, any further on that?']",question_answer,NTR.TO_87212,74,NTR.TO,2,2015-07-30 20:44:05,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

In a nutshell, the markets that are more challenging this year are U.S. and Brazil, and the markets that are supportive of higher one is China and India, and Asia in general has been very strong.

113,4319,Stephen F. Dowdle,"[""Sure. Chris, during the first half, Brazil got off to a slower start, the imports were down about 20%. This was due – 2014 was a very strong year, and at the beginning of the year there were higher inventories carried over. And couple that with some of the economic uncertainties, you have the real that's trading at a 12-year low, you had soybean prices coming down, you had rural credit availability, a bit of a problem. So, all of these factors contributed to a slow start. What we're seeing right now is we're seeing and expecting a – not the same kind of decline in the second half, and we've got – we're seeing a very strong vessel line-up here in July and August."", ""This has been supported by higher soybean prices in real terms.

We do believe and we have seen in last year and year-over-year that the current price environment stimulates volume growth.

The statement does not provide an opportunity on price improvement, I think that would not be entirely one that we'd support because we do believe that as market conditions improve, there is some opportunity.

I mean, as you well know, it's always a very difficult – inventories are very difficult to quantify. But if you look at it on a fertilizer year basis, if you recall a year ago, the market, there was no inventory in the system. The pipeline was dry, and we actually took a price increase a year ago during the summer-fill, which is unusual, and that was because of demand in the market, the need to restock. And so we started this current fertilizer, or the year that we just finished here, very strong with those shipments, and as we came into the spring and with some of the weather issues that we had, some of the delayed planting issues that we had, some of the economic headwinds that we had, both here and around the world, I think the expectation was, is that we weren't going to do in the summer-fill this year what we did last year."", ""In other words that the prices were likely not going to go up, but there was I think an anticipation that there would be a reset in prices on the downside, and so when people have the expectations that prices are going to decline, they naturally want to focus on making sure that they end the year with as little inventory as possible, and start holding back on their shipments, and we certainly saw that in April, May, and June. And I think that was certainly part of the decline that we saw, and yes there still was a little carryover this year, and that was I think more a reflection of some of the delayed planting and the shorter application window. But certainly as these prices have reset, our customers now see the value in where prices are, and that's why we had a good response to our summer-fill program.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_87212,74,NTR.TO,2,2015-07-30 20:44:05,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

Prior to my arrival, and this is a coincidence, the market demand was such that our assets ran at 70% plus. And by the way, this pertains as well to other participants in the industry. Demand has improved, and as you may recall, 2014 was an exception with 65 million tonnes. It was 7 million tonnes above the prior year of 2013. So, everyone had to or everyone did contribute to an extra 7 million tonnes globally which led to that increased number. So, we see a very similar scenario this year. So, for last, for 2014 and year-to-date 2015, so a year and a half, this is the operating motive. So, it's not a strategic change. It's an artifact of the much more significant demand we saw from 2013 to 2014.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_87212,74,NTR.TO,2,2015-07-30 20:44:05,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

166,4372,Jochen E. Tilk,"[""Yeah. I do think if I understand your question, right, I do believe that infrastructure and warehousing, handling, logistics is such a big factor. And we saw it – and two very good examples, domestically for PotashCorp, we really see how our strategy of having access to warehouses, our ability to move product is paying off. And we're building – we're currently constructing a 125,000 tonne warehouse in Hammond, near Chicago. We already have a railroad yard or access to a railroad yard, and this hub will really help us to move product reliably and quickly."", ""The fertilizer industry and the nutrient industry needs product quickly. It's a short season, and it's getting shorter. I mean product moves in a week, and suppliers and distributors have to respond to that."", ""Internationally, to your original question, I see exactly the same benefits. We added additional railcars to the Canpotex fleet, we're constantly looking at port access, the opportunity of port expansions and how we improve logistics. And that's what I see as part of the future. And some of the benefits we're now seeing in Brazil, to an earlier question. So I do see that as an opportunity where freight advantages, improved logistics are one of the ways of differentiating in a competitive environment.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_87212,74,NTR.TO,2,2015-07-30 20:44:05,Earnings call Q2 2015,2015

So, first, do you think this has been a major factor for your pricing? Second, does this keep happening?
