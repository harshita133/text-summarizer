Nutrien's first quarter results reflect the impact of structural supply issues and shifting buying patterns that have contributed to an unprecedented period of market volatility. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion, the second highest for any first quarter on record, continuing to demonstrate the advantages of our flexible, low-cost production assets and global distribution network. We invested $700 million to sustain and grow our assets and returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter. While our full year outlook is lower than previously expected, we are encouraged by the continued stabilization of crop nutrient markets and anticipate increased fertilizer demand in the second half of the year. We expect to generate strong cash flows in 2023 and maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation. Shifting to the highlights from the first quarter. Nutrien Ag Solutions results were impacted by delays to grow our purchases and to lower margins compared to the exceptionally strong period in 2022. We Retail fertilizer prices declined in the quarter, albeit at a slower pace than wholesale benchmark prices and margins were below normalized levels as we worked through higher cost inventory. We ended the quarter with U.S. fertilizer inventory down 10% year-over-year, leaving a significant amount of our spring fertilizer volume to procure in the second quarter. Crop Protection product margins were impacted by lower prices for certain herbicide products and and later grower engagement compared to the previous year. This resulted in a temporary build of crop protection inventory, but this product is moving through the channel in the second quarter as field work has accelerated. Seed sales and margins improved due to higher prices, increased crop acreage and the strong performance of our proprietary seed lines. We completed 8 retail acquisitions during the quarter in the U.S., Brazil and Australia. In Brazil, our primary focus in 2023 is on the integration of acquisitions completed last year. The results for our potash, nitrogen and phosphate business were impacted by lower benchmark prices compared to the exceptionally strong period in 2022. We had good initial uptake for our potash winter fill program in North America. However, volumes were down from the prior year as customers purchased on a just-in-time basis. Canpotex sold record volumes to Brazil, driven by strong demand for the Sofina planting season and to lower imports from Eastern European producers compared to Q1 2022. Potash shipments to spot markets in Asia declined as our customers work down inventory and contract settlements with India and China were delayed as buying patterns continue to evolve. Global potash prices were relatively stable to begin the year, but declined later in the quarter due to the lack of consistent market engagement. We adjusted potash production across our low-cost network and pulled forward maintenance activities, preserving the flexibility to quickly ramp up production when stronger demand reemerges. Nitrogen benchmark prices were highly volatile due to a sharp drop in European gas prices, lower Indian urea imports and weaker industrial demand. Our North American nitrogen plants operated very well in the quarter and benefited from low natural gas costs in comparison to other global producers. Trinidad was impacted by gas curtailments of approximately 20%, which was in line with our previous expectations. We are progressing well on engineering work for our Geismar clean ammonia project and remain on track to make a final investment decision in the second half of 2023. In recent months, we have received significant external interest regarding co-investment or potential equity partnerships in the project. We plan to explore these options as we continue our evaluation of the project with a view of maximizing value for shareholders. Our phosphate business benefited from the stability of our feed and industrial product lines, partially offsetting the impact of lower sales volumes and fertilizer prices. We completed maintenance and reliability initiatives during the quarter and are targeting utilization rates above 90% in the second half of the year. Turning to the outlook. Geopolitical and weather-related challenges continue to impact global agriculture commodity markets. The global grain stocks to use ratio is at its lowest point in more than 25 years, and we expect it will take multiple cropping cycles to restore stocks to more adequate levels. Agriculture is a seasonal business, and there has been some near-term pressure on crop prices resulting from a record Brazilian soybean harvest and favorable planting progress in the U.S. Even with this recent softening, new crop futures for corn, soybeans and wheat are around 15% above the 10-year average. Growers are increasing acreage and have the incentive to invest in their crop, leading to strong demand for crop inputs as the planting season progresses in the Northern Hemisphere. To give you some context from a fertilizer demand standpoint, our second quarter U.S. retail fertilizer sales volumes are currently up 40% compared to the previous year. With product moving rapidly through the supply chain, we have seen some spot shortages in the U.S., in particular, for potash and urea. This is highlighting the challenges that can emerge from just-in-time purchasing. Retail fertilizer inventories are projected to end the second quarter down significantly compared to last year, which supports the need for a strong summer refill. We expect second half global potash demand will be up significantly compared to the same period in 2022, with the majority of the increase in Brazil and North America, which are the 2 largest markets for our potash. The timing of a new China contract remains uncertain, but we do not view this as a significant impediment to a recovery in global demand. Global trade flows have evolved over the past year, and China's seaborne imports now represent only 5% of global shipments. For Nutrien, it also represents a relatively small percentage of our total sales as we have shifted more volume to higher netback markets. On the supply side, Belarus has gradually increased potash exports through ports in Russia, partially offset by lower Russian production producer exports. We expect Eastern European potash shipments will be up approximately 15% in 2023 compared to last year, but still down 30% from 2021. We maintained our global potash shipment forecast at 63 million to 67 million tonnes, which is well below the estimated trend demand of above 70 million tons. We expect increased demand as markets stabilize, driven by growth in global crop production, lower channel inventories and the need to replenish potassium levels in the soil. I will now turn it over to Pedro to review our guidance assumptions and capital allocation plans for 2023.""]",management_discussion

Our revised full year guidance reflects changes in fertilizer benchmark prices since mid-February and our expectation of a more stable market going forward. In retail, our initial guidance assume a reset in crop nutrient and crop protection margins compared to the extraordinary levels achieved in 2022. In North America, demand is accelerating as expected, but we have seen fertilizer margins temporarily drop below normalized levels as we work down higher cost inventory. We expect to end the spring season with very low inventories and for North America crop nutrient margins to recover in the second half. We could still see below normal margins in Brazil in the third quarter as grower purchases are not likely to accelerate until close to the spring planting season in September. Turning to potash, we assume North American prices remain firm through spring and then follow a typical seasonal pricing pattern. Offshore prices have moved lower in the second quarter due to the lack of consistent buying. However, we forecast prices to stabilize in the second half as demand increases. We lower our 2023 potash sales volume guidance to 13.5 million to 4.3 million tons, due to the delayed contract settlements and slightly higher export volumes from Eastern Europe. We have adjusted our production plans accordingly, and we'll maintain a flexible approach to our potash ramp-up, facing the timing of capital expenditures with the expected recovery in demand. The investments completed to date have provided for greater production flexibility and increased our autonomous mining capabilities. These are important initiatives that enhance safety and reliability while supporting the low-cost position of our potash mines. In nitrogen, we forecast a normal seasonal reset for urea and UAN prices following spring. We expect an increase in global ammonia prices during the second half as prices are currently trading well below the estimated margin of cost, which we do not believe is sustainable or an extended period. We are assuming U.S. natural gas prices will average around $3 per MMBtu in 2023 and Western Canadian gas below that level, continuing to position our nitrogen assets at the low end of the global cost curve. Cash from operating activities is projected at $5 billion to EUR 5.8 billion in 2023, a relatively small decline compared to our previous forecast. As we have stated before, one of the benefits of our integrated business is the countercyclical impacts on cash flow. We project a large increase release of working capital with a reset in fertilizer prices. And our cash conversion ratio would have been even higher this year, if not for the timing impact of cash tax payments. We continue to deploy a disciplined approach to capital allocation that balances our priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in sustainability and growth of the business, and providing meaningful return to shareholders. While our cash flow allows us to fund all of our strategic projects, and we have a strong balance sheet to cushion the volatility, we will continue to review our investments to ensure they provide the best return on investment through the cycle. We allocated $900 million of share repurchases in the first quarter and intend to remain opportunistic, taking advantage of our existing NCIB. We announced a 10% increase in our dividend per share in February that aligned to the significant reduction in share count over the previous 12 months. Since 2018, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 23% and increased the dividend per share by 33%, demonstrating our commitment to capital returns through the cycle. I'll now pass it back to Ken.""]",management_discussion

The fundamentals for our business remain strong. We anticipate increased fertilizer demand in the second half of 2023, and supply issues that emerged in 2022 have yet to be resolved.

So maybe I'll just do a bit of a flyover on some of the key markets, and then I'll pass it to Jason to talk about specific timing of application season I think generally, as Ken said in his comments, there's really 3 key themes here we see in potash globally. I think first, it remains a supply-constrained market. And really what we see relative to our expectations in February is about 1 million more tonnes coming out of the former Soviet Union as a whole. I think second, as Ken mentioned, we are seeing trade flows shift structurally. And really the biggest themes there that we see is the North American production is becoming more important innovator proportion of buying in markets like North America, Brazil and Southeast Asia, former Soviet Union production is disproportionately moving into China. And then third, production of lays is increasingly finding markets in China and Southeast Asia. And so I think those are the 3 biggest factors as it relates to the structural shifts. And third, as Ken mentioned, we do see demand recovering in the second half and certainly do see long-term trend demand intact. So maybe just to drill down into some of the markets more specifically. Brazil was certainly a bright spot in Q1. Capitec had record shipments into Brazil in Q1. We did see a recovery there, and we do expect a rebound for the remainder of the year and buying to accelerate to meet their seasonal means as we move through the second quarter and into the second half. From an India standpoint, obviously, there was contracts signed with major producers and suppliers recently. One of the big items that we're waiting for there, while we have seen some products start to move is a subsidy announcement from India, right now, we would probably be historically late for that announcement. So we expect that at any time. And we would anticipate that when that's announced, we'll see further movement in product into India. From a Southeast Asia standpoint, we have seen some volume moving to Southeast Asia. We've seen inventories that were higher costs from 2022 continue to be worked down. We did see some reengagement in buying following the Indian contract. Inventories are normalizing, and we are starting to see fresh purchases. And again, we would expect those to accelerate through the second quarter and into the second half. And then I think finally on China. From an inventory standpoint today, we would see port inventories in China between 2.3 million and 2.5 million tonnes, probably about 500,000 to 600,000 tonnes of that is sitting in bonded warehouses today. And certainly, we have seen that inventory be a little bit stickier because of the trade flow shifts that we've seen. But as Ken said, I think what we've seen over the past 12 months, certainly from a China perspective is that while the contract markets have historically been benchmarks or events that the global markets look to, in a year like 2023, with these trade flow shifts, we think China's seaborne imports are only going to represent about 5% of global shipments. And so we expect that this is going to be a trend that these contracts will be less significance to the global market over time and really a smaller part of the picture. So finally, in North America, as we've talked about, because of the lack of field activity in Q1, we had a seasonally slow Q1. But really, in April, things have picked up substantially. I was just in the field last week with our team. And as Ken said, product is moving extremely well. We saw one of the biggest drawdowns in the last 5 years, month-over-month between March and April in our customer-owned inventories, and certainly saw inland production of potash moving very well at our distribution terminals. So I think from a timing perspective, I'll just let Jason talk about some of the specifics on that.""]",question_answer

Just to start with Southeast Asia and the timing of shipments and applications in that market. It is a region, particularly as we look at Indonesia and Malaysia where there's a long lead time between purchases and applications. And that's part of the reason why the high-priced inventories are holding up there. So there's large volumes purchased early in the second half of last year that flowed in through the end of 2022 and carried over into early 2023 and start to see applications in late Q1 and those inventories moved lower through the second quarter of the year in Southeast Asia. And then in Brazil, in terms of the timing, just we did see unusually strong imports of potash in Brazil in the second quarter of last year, which really led to a buildup in inventories in that market in front of Q3, and we'd expect more normal levels of imports in through Q2 and then the seasonally normal volume of imports coming in late Q2, early Q3 in front of the applications for their spring season in September.""]",question_answer

So we intend to remain opportunistic in the market. As we mentioned before, we already since MOE bought 23% of our share count. We do have a very strong balance sheet that allows us to take a long-term view in terms of value and that continues to pay off in terms of our free cash flow per share. So just to kind of give you a quick compare, in 2021, when our EBITDA was $7.7 billion. Our free cash flow per share was $3.4 per share. And if we jump now to kind of a similar year, I'm excluding 2022 because, of course, it's like an anomalous year. In 2023, we have a kind of a midpoint of our guidance of about $7.3 million and our free cash flow per share is 4.7%. So that's an almost 40% increase in our free cash flow per share. So we think that strategy is paying off. We intend to use the balance sheet, and if we see value, we'll be opportunistic about it.""]",question_answer

And there's a few reasons for that. If we look at the assumptions when we talk about mid-cycle EBITDA of $9 billion. It's really predicated on the structural shift that we've seen in energy, agriculture and crop nutrient markets and really lending to what we see is a strip going forward that's about $50 more across crop nutrients than we had assumed prior to this conflict in Eastern Europe. It also assumes additional volumes. And so there's a timing effect here, obviously, as we look at wrapping up potash volumes over time. And as we talk about our brownfield investments in our nitrogen fleet and also our clean ammonia project, which is also going to bring volume. And then finally, when we talk about normalized EBITDA ranges within our retail business, and it is true that we've had a reset in our retail business. We talked about that at the end of last year. We expected that to happen this year, of course, as it relates to the softness that we saw in crop nutrient markets -- in the first quarter, that reset is bigger than we had anticipated. That's reflected in our results. But when we think about normalized EBITDA ranges of our retail business, it too contributes to that $9 billion mid cycle. So if we walk across those assumptions, there is a timing effect here, but we believe that those assumptions remain intact.""]",question_answer

We do see the shifting trade flows playing a role here. But nonetheless, even at 5% of global shipments, China is likely going to need 3.5 million tonnes or give or take 0.5 million tons on either side of that and on seaborne imports that are going to have to be met. And we ultimately believe that in the second half, China is going to need that volume. So we do see Canpotex playing a role in meeting those needs. But one of the other points that I'll call out again is the record volumes that we've seen in Q1 from Canpotex into Brazil. And the fact that we are seeing Canadian production become far more important in some of these other key markets, including Brazil and Southeast Asia. So when we consider the fact that we do believe China is going to have to come back to the market to meet its second half needs for potash, we expect Canpotex to play a role in that. And again, when we look at our projections across markets, we look at economics for growers in these markets and the healthy demand recovery that we expect. We would also see shipments growing in places like Southeast Asia and Brazil overall this year. So you put all of that together, and we do believe that we can get to a place that meets the shipment numbers that we've talked about. And certainly, in working with Canpotex, we also believe that we've got a supply chain that can deliver it and a production plan in Chris' business unit that can also get us there as well.""]",question_answer

So I would just add a few comments and maybe pass it over to Mark. I mean 2021, we saw potash demand shipments on the planet of about 70 million tons. And we saw that drop to 61 million tonnes last year and now seeing a rebound, we expect to 63 million to 67 million tonnes. And we're maintaining that range, albeit a supply-constrained environment. And importantly, this is a market that's growing. We've seen 2.8% compound annual growth rates in the potash market for the last 20 years. And we expect that to continue to grow for all the reasons that we talk about growing population and the need for more food. So we're in a market that's growing. And as we look at where that growth is going to take place, yes, last year, the North American market, and when we talked about 61 million tonnes, North American market was down significantly, and that was going to the late spring, whether last year. And here we are this year. And while we have seen some incredible volatility and movements of inventory, we are now in the heart of the planting season and seeing very strong movement of volumes in North America. Application rates are up, inventories are being drawn down. And as I said in the opening remarks, we've seen a 40% increase in Q2 volumes quarter-to-date over last year. So yes, as we look at where the volumes are going, it is tilted to North America. Maybe, Mark, you want to provide some detail around those numbers.""]",question_answer

And again, the assumptions are laid out in our investor package for the call, but we do expect North America to be back to a relatively historical level of shipments this year. So we're estimating 9.5 million to 10.5 million tonnes of shipments into North America. So 2022 is certainly an anomalous year with what we saw in terms of inventory stocking in drawdown and the return to normal will see us back in more normal levels in North America with shipments somewhere between 1.5 and 5 million tonnes. And so the split we would see between domestic intertenational is much more typical for us than sort of 1/3, roughly domestic and 2/3 internationally moving through Canpotex. And then just on your second question about where that growth is going to come from. I mean, as Ken talked about, the last few years have been certainly a major shock to the market, supply coming out and what we've seen from a pricing and inventories perspective. But we certainly believe that the long-term demand trend is intact in these markets. And certainly, we expect to see a rebound as I've talked about already in markets like Brazil and Southeast Asia, where Canpotex and Canadian production has become increasingly important from a share perspective. So the growth in those markets over time certainly can sustain the volume growth in our business from our perspective. And there's other markets that have become opportunities for Canpotex this environment. I think a great example of that is a destination like Bangladesh where we're expecting to ship over 0.5 million tons of their Canpotex this year, which really provides incremental opportunity. So notwithstanding the incremental production from for Soviet Union that's finding its way into China. We do see growth in a number of our important markets.""]",question_answer

So yes, we had started the year with a set of assumptions or beliefs about shipment side of that region and was really following last year where we saw substantive volumes of Belarus and Russia shut in with the effect of sanctions and to your question, well, Belarus and really difficulty getting access to Tidewater for seaborne exports and some of the logistical challenges with rail, albeit, as Mark mentioned earlier, we are seeing those rail movements increase or have seen them increase out of Belarus to China. So there is a bit of an outlet there. So when we started the year, we thought we said that Russian volumes, we thought would be down 15% to 30% and that Belarusian volumes would be down 40% to 60% compared to 2021 levels. If we look at export side of the region, we've adjusted those numbers so that we say, we think Belarusian volumes will be more like 25% to 40% and Russian volume is more like 25% to 35%. But importantly, if we look at just supply out of the region, while it is closer and maybe even a little bit above the top end of what we had assumed for exports out of the region, still 30% down from 2021 level. So that equates to about 9 million tons. So yes, I mean, while there is movement among those numbers, well, the reality is there's still a lot of volume that's not getting out of the country. What would it take? I mean, I think what we're seeing with Belarus for seaborne imports is that some of those volumes are going through Russian ports. But at the same time, that seems to be displacing Russian volumes out of those ports. And then finally, one of the other outlets is, of course, rail to China. We've talked about that. I think for Belarus to probably continue to increase volumes, I assume they'll be maximizing those rail volumes, but at the same time, what we believe need to see is new port capacity. And now we're talking about volumes from the region, new port capacity on the Russian coast. And of course, we've talked about, that's going to take a bit of time so that we believe exports out of the region will continue to be challenged.""]",question_answer

So I'll start with just obviously, as you've described it, the challenges on the supply side of the equation for potash. But as you put it, some anomalous effects that are leading to what we are experiencing a softening crop nutrient pricing, potash pricing in the first quarter of the year, which frankly, domestically is a rarity, something that we've really never seen. But that's just one of the anomalous observation. If we look at 2022, and obviously, this terrible event, which we all want to come to an end and stability back in the markets and the challenges that, that created for some of the big potash importers and users. The rush to get hands on inventory and the inventory build that took place and obviously, despite the price spike that followed that. I mean we saw that inventory built in there some weather-related effects there. So that when we headed into the fall, the the world started on a large inventory drawdown, watching prices soften. And that inventory draw down one of the most dramatic again, that we've ever seen carried through the first quarter of this year as farmers, as growers, and we saw that certainly in our North American markets. exercise really cautious buying behavior. We talked about it just-in-time buying and really only stepping into the market now when they actually have to as all of these big volumes go to ground. And so cautious by May or sorry. Wanting to shore up inventory with supply concerns in 2022, movements in price and then inventory drawdown coming into 2023 and the associated movement in price. And here we are, the backdrop for ag fundamentals remain strong. Grower affordability is good, given the reduction in crop nutrient prices. And so here we are with inventories clearing and prices stabilizing and volumes moving. So Steve, how this all translates into price and market volatility, what we would say is that we've now approached sort of a form of stability and what we would call sort of mid-cycle pricing for potash, and that's what we've assumed for the balance of the year. As it relates to these supply shortages, we're watching that incredibly closely. It's going to and has impacted how we think about increasing our own volumes. It will continue to do that as we seek to meet the needs of our own customers. But yes, some of the supply challenges remain, and we'll see how that plays out over the balance of the year.

I think first and foremost, we continue to contend that we've got, I think, the best build the most ideally positioned in the most robust distribution network in North America for potash, and the majority of those assets are owned assets. As I mentioned, I was just out at our Hamon Indiana terminal last week, which has about 80,000 tonnes of storage. And so our primary mechanism for moving product into the North American market is through our own warehouse and distribution system. From an efficiency perspective, we do have agreements with some customers. Nutrien Ag Solutions is one of those customers as well as our other major customers. And that's really efficiency from a logistics standpoint, so that we're not spending on necessary unnecessary dollars where they're not needed on distribution infrastructure and taking advantage of the assets that exist in market. And from a pricing standpoint, actually, things have been relatively straightforward as we've talked about in the commentary today. We saw product move very quickly and a lot of hand to mouth buying. So what was being sold was largely going directly to ground and moving through the channel quite quickly. And what we found from a commercial perspective generally is that as we've seen the supply-demand shortages emerge at inland distribution points, we've been tracking those prices higher as they emerge throughout the spring season.""]",question_answer

So I think with respect to mid-cycle prices, as Ken said, when we came out at last year's Investor Day and talked about the structural shift that we expected from all the factors that I mentioned today, our expectation was that generally on average across the fertilizer price complex that we would see prices shift by about $50 across all the nutrients probably specifics in every product line is beyond the scope of today's discussion. But I think what we're seeing generally is that as prices are stabilizing, as Ken has talked about, and that process continues for both nitrogen and potash domestically and internationally. Currently, prices are sitting, give or take, probably within $20 or $30 of those assumptions that we made in terms of what new mid-cycle prices would look like. So when we look across the fertilizer complex and we see things stabilizing today, that is what's inherent in our guidance, as Pedro and Ken described.

The reality is, again, that we are in a market that's growing, and we believe that, that's going to carry on for the absolute foreseeable future.

We really have seen things kick off at a frantic pace as planting activity started in April. And so again, just to look at benchmark prices that are published as an example, if we look back to some of the lower values we saw in Q1, sort of in the $370 per tonne range at NOLA for potash. We've seen firming of approximately $40 and seeing really good uptake in those values. And if we look at inland terminals or inland distribution points that really have been challenged logistically by the just-in-time purchasing behavior. We've seen values increase in excess of that and in some cases, substantially. And I think when we go back to talking about the North American agricultural supply chain, one of the things that we talked about in February was that if we were to see this just-in-time purchasing behavior persists that because of the significant needs for crop nutrients and how fast the crop can get planted, we would expect to see some logistical premiums emerge because of the supply chain correction. So I think we have seen that and certainly have seen potash prices firm in season and have sought to sell into that strength to the extent possible and support our customers.

Nutrien’s first quarter results reflect the impact of structural supply issues and shifting buying patterns that have contributed to an unprecedented period of market volatility. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.4 billion the second highest for any first quarter on record. Continuing to demonstrate the advantages of our flexible low cost production assets and global distribution network. We invested $700 million to sustain and grow our assets and returned over $1.1 billion to shareholders in the first quarter.', 'While our full year outlook is lower than previously expected, we are encouraged by the continued stabilization of crop nutrient markets and anticipate increased fertilizer demand in the second half of the year. We expect to generate strong cash flows in 2023 and maintain a balanced and disciplined approach to capital allocation.', 'Shifting to the highlights from the first quarter. Nutrien Ag Solutions results were impacted by delay to grow our purchases and to lower margins compared to the exceptionally strong period and 2022. Retail fertilizer prices declined in the quarter, albeit at a slower pace than wholesale benchmark prices and margins were below normalized levels as we worked through higher cost inventory.', 'We ended the quarter with U.S. fertilizer inventory down 10% year-over-year, leaving a significant amount of our spring fertilizer volume to procure in the second quarter. Crop protection product margins were impacted by lower prices for certain herbicide products and later in grower -- in later grower engagement compared to the previous year. This resulted in a temporary build of crop protection inventory. But this product is moving through the channel in the second quarter as fieldwork has accelerated.', 'Seed sales and margins improved due to higher prices, increased crop acreage and the strong performance of our proprietary seed lines. We completed eight retail acquisitions during the quarter in the U.S., Brazil and Australia. In Brazil, our primary focus in 2023 is on the integration of acquisitions completed last year. The results were our potash nitrogen and phosphate business were impacted by lower benchmark prices compared to the exceptionally strong period in 2022.', 'We had good initial uptake for our potash which are filled program in North America. However, volumes were down from the prior year as customers purchased on a just in time basis.', 'Canpotex sold record volumes to Brazil, driven by strong demand for the spring planting season and to lower imports from Eastern European producers compared to Q1 2022. Potash shipments to spot markets in Asia declined as our customers work down inventory and contract settlements with India and China were delayed as buying patterns continued to evolve.', 'Global potash prices were relatively stable to begin the year, but declined later in the quarter due to the lack of consistent market engagement. We adjusted potash production across our low cost network and pulled forward maintenance activities preserving the flexibility to quickly ramp up production when stronger demand re-emerges.', 'Nitrogen benchmark prices were highly volatile due to a sharp drop in European gas prices, lower Indian urea imports and weaker industrial demand. Our North American nitrogen plants operated very well in the quarter and benefited from low natural gas costs in comparison to other global producers. Trinidad was impacted by a gas curtailments of approximately 20%, which was in line with our previous expectations.', 'We are progressing well on engineering work for our Geismar clean ammonia project and remain on track to make a final investment decision in the second half of 2023. In recent months, we have received a significant external interest regarding co-investment, or potential equity partnerships in the project. We plan to explore these options as we continue our evaluation of the project with a view of maximizing value for shareholders.', 'Our phosphate business benefited from the stability of our feed and industrial product lines, partially offsetting the impact of lower sales volumes and fertilizer prices. We completed maintenance and reliability initiatives during the quarter and are targeting utilization rates above 90% in the second half of the year.', 'Turning to the outlook, geopolitical and weather related challenges continue to impact global agriculture commodity markets. The global grain stocks to use ratio is at its lowest point in more than 25 years. And we expect it will take multiple cropping cycles to restore stocks to more adequate levels.', 'Agriculture is a seasonal business, and there has been some near term pressure on crop prices resulting from a record Brazilian soybean harvest and favorable planting progress in the U.S. Even with this recent softening new crop futures for corn, soybeans and wheat around 15% above the 10-year average. Growers are increasing acreage and have the incentive to invest in their crop, leading to strong demand for crop inputs as the planting season progresses in the northern hemisphere.', 'To give you some context from a fertilizer demand standpoint, our second quarter U.S. retail fertilizer sales volumes are currently up 40% compared to the previous year. With product moving rapidly through the supply chain we have seen some spot shortages in the U.S. and particular for potash and urea. This is highlighting the challenges that can emerge from just in time purchasing.', 'Retail fertilizer inventories are projected to end the second quarter down significantly compared to last year, which supports the need for a strong summer refill.', 'We expect the second half global potash demand will be up significantly compared to the same period in 2022. With the majority of the increase in Brazil and North America, which are the two largest markets for our potash. The timing of a new China contract remains uncertain, but we do not view this as a significant impediment to our recovery and global demand.', ""Global trade flows have evolved over the past year and China's seaborne imports now represent only 5% of global shipments. For Nutrien, it also represents a relatively small percentage of our total sales, so we have shifted more volume to higher net back markets."", 'On the supply side, Belarus has gradually increased potash exports through ports in Russia, partially offset by lower Russian production producer exports. We expect Eastern European potash shipments will be up approximately 15% in 2023 compared to last year, but still down 30% from 2021. We maintained our global potash shipment forecast at 63 million to 67 million tonnes, which is well below the estimated trend demand of above 70 million tonnes. We expect increased demand as markets stabilized driven by growth and global crop production, lower channel inventories and the need to replenish potassium levels in the soil.', 'I will now turn it over to Pedro to review our guidance assumptions and capital allocation plans for 2023.']",management_discussion

Our revised full year guidance reflects changes in fertilizer benchmark prices since mid-February and our expectation of a boy stable market going forward. In retail, our initial guidance assumes a reset in crop nutrient and crop protection margins compared to the extraordinary levels achieved in 2022.', 'In North America, demand is accelerating as expected. But we have seen fertilizer margins temporarily drop below normalized levels, as we work down higher cost inventory. We expect to end the spring season with very low inventories and for North America crop nutrient margins to recover in the second half. We could still see below normal margins in Brazil in the third quarter as grower purchases are not likely to accelerate until closer to the spring planting season in September.', 'Turning to potash. We assume North American prices remain firm through spring and then follow a typical seasonal pricing pattern. Offshore prices have moved lower in second quarter due to the lack of consistent buying, however, we forecast prices to stabilize in the second half, as demand increases. We lower our 2023 potash sales volume guidance to 13.5 million to 14.3 million tonnes due to the delayed contract settlements and slightly higher export volumes from Eastern Europe.', 'We have adjusted our production plans accordingly and will maintain a flexible approach to our potash ramp up basing the timing of capital expenditures with the expected recovery in demand.', 'The investments completed to-date have provided for greater production flexibility and increased our autonomous mining capabilities. These are important initiatives that enhance safety and reliability while supporting the low cost position of our potash mines.', 'In nitrogen, we forecasted normal season reset for urea any UAN prices following spring. We expect an increase in global ammonia prices during the second half as prices are currently trading well below the estimated marginal cost, which we do not believe is sustainable over an extended period. We are assuming U.S. natural gas prices will average around $3 per MMBtu in 2023 and Western Canadian gas below that level. Continuing to position our nitrogen assets at the low end of a global cost curve.', 'Cash from operating Activities is projected at $5 billion to $5.8 billion in 2023. A relatively small decline compared to our previous forecast. As we have stated before one of the benefits of our integrated business is the counter cyclical impacts on cash flow. We project large increase -- release of working capital with a reset in fertilizer prices. And now our cash conversion ratio would have been even higher this year, if not for the timing impact of cash tax payments.', 'We continue to deploy a disciplined approach to capital allocation that balances our priorities of maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in sustainability and growth of the business and providing meaningful return to shareholders. While our cash flow allows to fund all of our strategic projects, and we have a strong balance sheet to cushion the volatility, we will continue to review our investments to ensure they provide the best return on investment through this cycle.', 'We allocated $900 million to share repurchases in the first quarter and intend to remain opportunistic, taking advantage of our existing and CIB. We announced a 10% increase in our dividend per share in February that aligned to the significant reduction in share count over the previous 12 months. Since 2018, we have reduced our outstanding share count by 23% and increased the dividend per share by 33%, demonstrating our commitment to capital returns through the cycle.', ""I'll pass it back to Ken.""]",management_discussion

So maybe I'll just do a bit of a flyover on some of the key markets. And then I'll pass it to Jason to talk about specific timing of application. I think, generally, as Ken said in his comments, there's really three key themes here we see in potash globally. I think first, there remains a supply constrained market. And really what we see relative to our expectations in February, is about a million more tonnes coming out of the former Soviet Union as a whole."", 'I think second, as Ken mentioned, we are seeing trade flows shift structurally. And really, the biggest themes there that we see is that North American production is becoming more important and a bigger proportion of buying in markets like North America, Brazil, and Southeast Asia, Former Soviet Union production is disproportionately moving into China.', 'And then third, production of Laos is increasingly finding markets in China and Southeast Asia. And so, I think those are the three biggest factors as it relates to the structural shifts. And third, as Ken mentioned, we do see demand recovering in the second half and certainly do see long term trend demand and tap.', 'So maybe just to drill down into some of the markets more specifically. Brazil was certainly a bright spot in Q1, Canpotex had record shipments into Brazil in Q1. We did see a recovery there and we do expect to rebound for the remainder of the year and buying to accelerate to meet their seasonal needs as we move through the second quarter and into the second half.', ""From an India standpoint, obviously there was contract signed with major producers and suppliers recently. One of the big items that we're waiting for there while we have seen some products start to move, is a subsidy announcement from India. Right now we would probably be historically wait for that announcement. So we expect that at any time. And we would anticipate that when that's announced, we'll see further movement in India."", ""From Southeast Asia standpoint, we have seen some volume moving to Southeast Asia, we've seen inventories that were higher costs for 2022, continue to be work down. We did see some reengagement and buying following the Indian contract, inventories are normalizing and we are starting to see fresh purchases. And again, we would expect those to accelerate through the second quarter and into the second half."", ""And then I think finally on China, from an inventory standpoint today, we would see port inventories of China between 2.3 and 2.5 million tonnes, probably about 500,000 or 600,000 tonnes of that is sitting in bonded warehouses today. And certainly we have seen that inventory be a little bit stickier because of the trade flow shifts that we've seen."", ""But as Ken said, I think what we've seen over the past 12 months, certainly from China perspective is that, while the contract markets have historically been benchmarks or events that the goal of markets look to in a year like 2023. With these trade flows shifts, we think China's seaborne imports are only going to represent about 5% of global shipments. And so we expect that this is going to be a trend that these contracts will be of less significance to the global market over time, and really a smaller part of the picture."", ""So finally, in North America, as we've talked about, because of the lack of field activity in Q1, we had a seasonally slow Q1, but really an April, things have picked up substantially. I was just in the field last week with our team. And as Ken said, products moving extremely well. We saw one of the biggest draw downs in the last five years month-over-month between March and April, in our customer owned inventories, and certainly saw inland production of potash moving very well at our distribution terminals."", ""So I think from a timing perspective, I'll just let Jason talk about some of the specifics on that.""]",question_answer

Just to start with Southeast Asia and the timing of shipments and applications in that market. It is a region, particularly as we look at Indonesia and Malaysia, where there's a long lead time between purchases and applications. And that's part of the reason why the high priced inventories are holding up there. So there's large volumes purchased earlier in the second half of last year that flowed in through the end of 2022 and carried over and early 2023 and start to see applications in late Q1 and those inventories move lower through the second quarter of the year in Southeast Asia."", ""And then in Brazil, in terms of the timing, we just did see unusually strong imports of potash from Brazil in the second quarter of last year, which really led to a buildup in inventories and that mark in front of Q3 and we'd expect more normal levels of imports into Q2 and the seasonally normal volume of imports coming in late Q2 early Q3 in front of the applications for their spring season in September.""]",question_answer

And there's a few reasons for that. I mean when you look at the assumptions when we talk about mid cycle EBITDA of $9 billion, it's really predicated on the structural shift that we've seen in energy, agriculture and crop nutrient markets, and really lending to what we see is a strip going forward, that's about $50 more across crop nutrients than we had assumed prior to this conflict in Eastern Europe."", ""It also assumes additional volumes. And so there's a timing effect here, obviously, as we look at wrapping up potash volumes over time, and as we talk about our brownfield investments and our nitrogen fleet, and also clean ammonia project, which is also going to bring volume."", ""And then finally, when we talk about normalized EBITDA ranges within our retail business, and it is true that we've had a reset in our retail business, we talked about that at the end of last year. We expected that to happen this year, of course, as it relates to the softness that we saw in probably nutrient markets in the first quarter that reset is bigger than we had anticipated. That's reflected in our results. But when we think about normalized EBITDA ranges that of our retail business, it too contributes to that $9 billion mid cycle.

We do see the shifting trade flows playing a role here.

So we do see Canpotex playing a role in meeting those needs. But one of the other points that I'll call out again, is the record volumes that we've seen in Q1 from Canpotex into Brazil. And the fact that we are seeing Canadian production become far more important in some of these other key markets, including Brazil and Southeast Asia.

So, we're in a market that's growing and as we look at where that growth is going to take place.

And again, the assumptions are laid out in our investor package for the call. But we do expect North America to be back to a relatively historical level of shipments this year. So we're estimating 9.5 million to 10.5 million tonnes of shipments into North America. So 2022 is certainly an anomalous year with what we saw in terms of inventory, stocking and drawdown. And the return to normal will see us back in more normal levels in North America with shipments somewhere between 4.5 million and 5 million tonnes."", 'So the split we would see between domestic and international is much more typical for us and sort of one-third roughly domestic and two-thirds international and moving through Canpotex.', ""And then just on your second question about where that growth is going to come from, as Ken talked about. The last few years have been certainly a major shock to the market supply coming out and what we've seen from a pricing and inventories perspective. But we certainly believe that the long term demand trend is intact in these markets.

And there's other markets that have become opportunities for Canpotex in this environment. I think a great example of that is a destination like Bangladesh, where we're expected to ship over half a million tonnes through Canpotex this year, which really provides incremental opportunity.

And to your question, Will, Belarus in really difficulty getting access to Tidewater for seaborne exports, and some of the logistical challenges with rail. Albeit as Mark mentioned earlier, we are seeing those rail movements increase or have seen them increase out of Belarus to China.', 'So there is a bit of an outlet there. So when we started the year, we thought that we said that Russian volumes we thought would be down 15% to 30%. And that Belarusian volumes would be down 40% to 60%, compared to 2021 levels.', ""If you look at exports out of the region, we've adjusted those numbers, so that we say, we think Belarusian volumes will be more like 25% to 40%, and Russian volumes more like 25% to 35%. But importantly, if we look at just supply out of the region, while it is closer and maybe even a little bit above the top end of what we had assumed were experts out of the region, still 30% down from 2021 level. So that equates about 9 million tonnes."", ""So, I mean, while there is movement among those numbers, well, the reality is there's still a lot of volume that's not getting out of the country. What would it take? I mean, what I think what we're seeing with Belarus for seaborne imports is that some of those volumes are going through Russian ports. But at the same time, that seems to be displacing Russian volumes out of those ports."", ""And then finally, one of the other outlets, is, of course, rail to China, we've talked about that. I think for Belarus to probably continue to increase volumes, I assume there'll be maximizing those rail volumes. But at the same time, what we would, we believe need to see is New Port capacity. And now we're talking about volumes from the region, new port capacity on the Russian coast. And of course, we've talked about that's going to take a bit of time so that we believe exports out of the region will continue to be challenged.""]",question_answer

So I'll start with just obviously, as you've observed described it. There’s challenges on the supply side of the equation for potash. But as you put it, some anomalous effects that are leading to what we are experiencing is as softening, crop nutrient pricing, potash pricing in the first quarter of the year, which frankly, domestically is a rarity, something that we've really never seen."", ""But that's just one of the anomalous observations. If you look at we look at 2022 and obviously this terrible event which we all want to come to an end and stability back in the markets and the challenges that created for some of the big potash importers and users. And the inventory the rush to get hands on inventory and the inventory build that took place. And obviously the price spike that followed that. I mean, we saw that inventory build and there are some weather related effects there. So that when we headed into the fall there -- the world's started on a large inventory drawdown watching prices soften."", ""And that inventory drawdown one of the most dramatic again, that we've ever seen, carried through the first quarter of this year, as farmers as growers, and we saw that certainly in our North American markets, exercise really cautious buying behavior, we talked about it just in time buying and really only stepping into the market now when they absolutely have to as all of these big volumes go to ground."", 'And so cautious buying may -- sorry, wanting to shore up inventory with supply concerns in 2022 movements in price. And then inventory drawdown coming into 2023 and the associated movement in price. And here we are the backdrop for Ag fundamentals remain strong. Grower affordability is good given the reduction in crop nutrient prices. And so here we are with inventories clearing and prices stabilizing, and volumes moving.', ""So Steve, how this all translates into price and market volatility, what we would say is that we've now approach sort of a form of stability, and what we would call sort of mid-cycle pricing for potash. And that's what we've assumed for the balance of the year. As it relates to the supply shortages, we're watching that incredibly closely. It's going to and has impacted how we think about increasing our own volumes. It will continue to do that as we seek to meet the needs of our own customers."", ""But yes, there's some of the supply challenges remain and we'll see how that plays out over the balance of the year.

Overall, I think first and foremost, we continue to contend that we've got I think, the best build the most ideally positioned and the most robust distribution network in North America for potash.
