You've been an outstanding member of this team for many years and have enjoyed an exceptional career. You are appreciated and you will be missed. I know you're very pleased to be passing your charge over to Jeff, who I know many of you already know as our Vice President of Investor Relations.So good morning, everyone, and welcome to Nutrien's second quarter earnings call. Today, I will recap the actions our teams have taken to fully benefit from excellent agriculture fundamentals and the demonstration of the advantages of our global integrated business structure, which together allowed us to execute on delivery of record performance for the quarter and for the first half of the year.This morning, I will also provide an update on the outlook and decisive actions that we have taken that allowed us to increase our annual adjusted EBITDA guidance to a midpoint over $6 billion for 2021, an increase of over 33%. Furthermore, we will illustrate the momentum that we will expect to carry forward well into 2022 and how the Nutrien team are enhancing our unique market position to drive value.So first of all, I would like to thank all our employees for the dedication and commitment they demonstrate each and every day in support of our grower customers in the more than 40 countries that we serve and as we work to feed a growing world. These efforts are especially apparent through the busy application seasons when our approximately 3,600 crop advisers are working directly with our grower customers as we produce to safely deliver nearly 30 million tonnes of potash, nitrogen and phosphate globally.Myself, the Board and all employees are very proud of how our potash team has responded to increase production significantly from our flexible, reliable, low-cost 6-mine network in the second half of the year to ensure our growers around the world have the potash they need to meet the ever-growing demand for food.So now turning to our results. Our first half adjusted EBITDA was over $3 billion, up 36% over last year's level. We delivered excellent results across all businesses, geographies and for most products and services. The key driver was impressive team execution with our well-positioned assets, higher prices for crop and fertilizers, and robust global demand. Our business also generated notable free cash flow of $1.9 billion in the first half of the year.Nutrien Ag Solutions, our retail operations, achieved a 24% year-over-year increase in adjusted EBITDA for the first half of 2021. In fact, almost all of our retail metrics showed significant improvement, and we are on track to meet or exceed our longer-term targets ahead of schedule.When we look across our Nutrien businesses, we generated a combined $1.2 billion in adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter, year-over-year potash earnings up 48% and nitrogen and phosphate businesses up 45%. The increase was due to continued focus on managing costs, making operational excellence core to everything we do, supported by stronger pricing. Our wholesale marketing and sales team execution was outstanding. Our team ensured we did not get overcommitted too early and optimized our retail distribution system.We evaluate our retail business on a first half and second half basis, representing the spring and fall application seasons. In the first 6 months of this year, we witnessed strong year-over-year performance across all geographies in the majority of our product shelves.Adjusted EBITDA in the first 6 months in the U.S., Canada and Australia were up over 20%, driven by organic growth, while our South American team's EBITDA was nearly double last year, driven by their strategic acquisitions. By product shelf, the biggest increase in earnings was for our crop nutrients with per tonne margins benefiting from well-placed inventories in a rising fertilizer price environment as well as record sales volumes.Volumes for crop protection and seed were higher year-over-year, helping drive a significant increase in gross profit. The increase was also due to improved proprietary product performance across all geographies and products with profits from all proprietary products up an average of 13% year-over-year. We also delivered excellent retail performance relative to our long-term targets, adjusted EBITDA percentages surpassing 11.4% compared to 10.3% in the first half of last year, partially supported by strategic fertilizer procurement.Our working capital, as a proportion of sales and cash operating coverage far exceeded our long-term targets, and our average EBITDA per location showed significant year-over-year improvement. The ongoing progress in these metrics is made possible by our continued focus on meeting growers' needs while also rationalizing our network, optimizing working capital and expanding our proprietary product line.We also reported $1.6 billion in digitally enabled sales in the first half of the year, nearly double the same period in 2020 and processed approximately 1.5 million grower payments through our system. We also continue to grow our retail business in Brazil and recently announced an agreement to acquire Terra Nova, the fourth value-enhancing [ Brazilian ] acquisition in the past 18 months. With this transaction, we operate 33 branches in Brazil and are well on our way to generating $100 million in run rate EBITDA by 2023. Our retail team continues to demonstrate exceptional performance across the board and in all geographies in which we operate.Our potash group performance has been outstanding. Ken and his team responded to market conditions and have fully delivered commitments to our customers while taking action to increase sales and production significantly to ensure our customers have the product they need. We are the only producer globally with the capability to respond. We delivered record volumes in the first half of 2021 and are on track to achieve a full year record.We are focusing all-time high global potash consumption in 2021 due to exceptional spot market demand in the U.S. and Brazil and in Southeast Asia, where we saw a significant market recovery this year. The demand has positioned Canpotex to place greater emphasis on these higher netback markets compared to contract markets of China and India. Overall, we project to produce nearly 14 million tonnes of potash in 2021. In fact, by the fourth quarter, we anticipate Nutrien to serve potash production to approximately 17 million tonnes on an annualized equivalent basis. We will continue to be proactive and flexible with our operating rate.Raef's teams in nitrogen and phosphate delivered excellent results in the first half, capturing much stronger prices and for nitrogen achieved a 92% ammonia operating rate despite increased turnaround activity and weather-related challenges. Phosphate margins this quarter reached an impressive $195 per tonne, and nitrogen margins averaged $182 a tonne, both were up almost 60% year-over-year despite higher input costs.We continue to benefit from the brownfield expansion projects completed over the past few years, which have both expanded production capability and increased product mix flexibility. These results also demonstrate our ability to leverage the competitive advantages of our extensive production and distribution network to execute on emerging market opportunities.For the near-term outlook, there is a wide range of crop conditions across North America. Crop maturity is generally ahead of normal, which bodes well for the fall application window. We may see some pullback on fertilizer applications in severe drought areas, such as Western Canada this fall. Overall, in North America, we expect solid crop input demand, supported by continued above-average crop prices. In Australia, very favorable weather conditions also continue to support strong crop input demand. Some ongoing weather challenges in Brazil have impacted yields for certain crops this year, but the outlook for next season is a further expansion in seeded acreage, which will support demand for all crop inputs.For fertilizers, the current price environment is a result of robust demand for all nutrients, driven by supportive agriculture and industrial market fundamentals. We expect these market dynamics will continue to support prices into 2022. That said, fertilizer affordability is something we watch closely. But even at today's elevated prices, most fertilizer to crop price indices are close to average levels and grower margins continue to be very favorable into 2022. We expect global potash demand in 2021 to be at record levels between 69 million and 71 million tonnes and global inventory levels in key regions to remain very low.There is no news at this point about a potential contract with China or India. However, we continue to believe that China will need to negotiate a new contract before the end of the year as their inventories continue to draw down as Chinese domestic demand has been seen as robust. Canpotex is already fully committed right into November, and we'll continue to focus on higher netback regions.We believe the future outlook for our company is excellent. We expect crop prices to remain well above historic levels and fertilizer markets to remain tight. We will also benefit from our ongoing commitments to operational excellence, execution, a keen focus on cost and inventory management, continued value-added growth and a strengthening return on investment. As such, we raised our consolidated annual adjusted EBITDA guidance by more than $1.5 billion or over 33% and our EPS by nearly 70%. This is due to stronger earnings outlook across all business lines and executing on our competitive advantages.We believe this positive earnings outlook will continue into 2022, further strengthening our balance sheet. We will maintain our disciplined compete for capital approach, which includes the potential for further investment in the business, deleveraging of the balance sheet and additional returns to our shareholders. Our purpose is to help growers increase food production in a sustainable manner. There is no better example of this commitment than our responsiveness of our team to quickly and safely bring on an additional 1 million tonnes of potash production to improve access of this important nutrient for growers globally.These actions also deliver significant financial value for our shareholders as the increase in production accounted for approximately 25% of the $900 million increase in our potash adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2021. Another example of executing in line with our purpose is our feeding the future plan in 2030 sustainability commitments, which includes our ongoing focus on improving carbon outcomes. We are reducing the carbon footprint at our facilities, making great progress on our industry-leading carbon program at the farm level and our recent announcement on a partnership to develop a marine vessel that is powered by low carbon ammonia as a fuel.Nutrien is committed to ensuring our strategy and operations remain world-class and successful over the long term, which is supported by strong integration and management of ESG risk and opportunities into our strategy and our execution plans. We believe the outlook for Nutrien is exceptional, with crop and fertilizer prices anticipated to remain well above historic levels into 2022. No other company is more advantageously positioned across the value chain to be a catalyst for positive change in the global crop production system and help growers around the world feed a growing world.So I want to thank you for joining the Nutrien team today, and we're all looking forward to your questions.""]",management_discussion

So you're going to generate $6 billion, $6.5 billion of EBITDA this year. And even if prices moderate a little bit, you'll probably do something similar next year, and that's a lot of free cash flow to generate, especially considering you don't have any major capital projects. So in that context and rather than talking about your compete for capital philosophy, can you give us some actual goal posts in terms of what you have planned? How much debt reduction do you want to see over the next 18 months? You have a buyback authorization. Do you expect to be finished that within a year from now? How much have you earmarked for M&A in retail, whether it's in the U.S. or Brazil?""]",question_answer

And Pedro and I have those good discussions and actually quite frequently, and it's an outstanding year, gives us a number of opportunities, including both strategic and also, as you mentioned, a buyback relative to our strategic initiatives.

To your point, we will continue our disciplined capital allocation approach, which would involve basically sustaining our assets. And on this one, we kind of guided to a little bit more expenditure as we are a little bit depressed in the past due to COVID restrictions that we couldn't do what we needed to do in our different facilities. We have increased the dividend earlier this year, and we are looking into the balance sheet now that we are above mid-cycle prices in terms of opportunities to delever. That very much will depend on how much we will do, will depend on how we look through the cycle, and we'd like to position ourselves to have flexibility in the future. So I don't have a specific number for you as we are looking at our various options for the future.But in terms of the compete for capital approach, as you mentioned, we do have options there, too, both organically and inorganically, and we are already starting to deploy that. You have seen us do some acquisitions in Brazil. We're also investing some in our ESG projects for nitrogen, and we'll continue to look at those in the future. And we are -- as you pointed out, we still have the NCIB option that we will be considering together with all the other ones. So it is a fluid environment here. So we're going to be analyzing our options, and we'll come back to you with more specific points as soon as we have them and we can tell you in more detail.""]",question_answer

When we talk about crop protection, I think you want to be more specific on the NPK case side of things. And I guess if we look at the end of quarter 2, we're probably a little bit higher from a revenue perspective. What we've got in inventory today on NP&K about $150 million higher in the U.S. than last year. That's planned as we're starting to load in product to date for what we anticipate to be a good fall application season and trying to get some product -- when you look at how much product we have to move through our system, we have to get a really early start from a logistics and supply chain side of things with it.And then if you look at that higher inventory value, you also got to give credibility from the standpoint of we're looking at higher product pricing than we were looking at a year ago as well on it.

Steve, we do have visibility through Canpotex. In fact, they just released a few weeks ago that they are committed into November now. So the remaining volumes to be committed in the year are shrinking. In North America, similarly, we're committed right through October, and again, uncommitted volumes relatively small compared to what we're doing for the year.So with respect to third quarter realizations, we can follow benchmark prices. There's always a lag between what the benchmark prices are being reported at and what we're realizing and that has to do with the 2- to 3-month lag on contracting and delivery. And I'll also say that in this rising price environment at times, those reported prices are based on thinly traded volumes.

But as Jeff said, we're expecting good engagement.

Well, let me start with, I think, an important comment that we expect global demand to continue to grow by 2% to 3% a year. So if you do the math on that, over the next 9 -- 8, 9 years, that's 14 million to 23 million metric tonnes. And that's why I would say that Ken and his group are thinking about, as we talked about the annualized run rate of about 17 million tonnes by the fourth quarter. So we really look at this as the opportunity for our shareholders, but at the same time, there tends to be value destruction when we get to these higher prices. When we have Brazil sitting at [ 680 ], those you get to a level of -- some level of concern whether they'll simply mine the soil.So I think the additional -- for us, the additional production capability could be further leveraged in 2022. But I think that's if the market needs it. And then we also have a good line of sight to about another 5 million tonnes of low-cost brownfield capacity. So we're going to continue to invest in already low-cost position that we have and leading the industry in that with our flexible mine network. And so our focus at this time is going to be on our potash operations and how we're positioned to service the market while being price sensitive. We are enjoying some prices, and we want to continue to enjoy these prices, and that's how we're going to think about servicing our growers to keep them in the game and price accordingly.

We're seeing some indications that they will be down.And obviously, when you're in a very hot and dry conditions, that really doesn't create a lot of disease, especially in our permanent crops.

Let me just make a couple of comments, and you've got a lot of good questions in there, and you talk about volatility, and that's the commodity business that we're in. I think the fundamentals for us are that we do expect to see strong follow-through. And regardless of what happens with the Belorussians, I think we're still going to be in a very strong position. It's just sort of creates an amplifier of a combination of results and the potash that we're capable of bringing on.As to your point, I mean, we delivered a new company record with an adjusted EBITDA of $3 billion in the first half of the year, which is a 36% year-over-year. When you talk about the performance and the earnings perspective, and our significant increase in guidance with our full year EBITDA, as you would know, is $6 billion to $6.4 billion. So that's up 70%. But we do see the ability to follow through with this crop. I mean all the signals when you look at; the markets are trading flat, there's a demand for corn to be delivered in the nearby, yet, at the same time, the deferred, I mean, there's not a -- it's not necessarily a big inverse there. We're really demonstrating strong corn prices even not only through this new crop, but into the next new crop.So we really see a real opportunity here to sustain these prices for an extended period of time. And we get into these type of cycles. I mean, it's hard to tell when they end. They end dramatically and quickly. But if you look at the supply and demand, particularly the supply right now is on the low side. We've got certain countries that are almost down to their level of food security in terms of what they have in their inventories, both in crop and in terms of the crop inputs. And we're already seeing that with China where they're asking their producers, their production system to withhold and look at -- focus internal to the system.

I think that's just really a demonstration and testament to our capabilities here.For 2021, we're committed with Canpotex through November and domestically through October. So in large part, the table is set for us. We do have some uncommitted volumes. So if we look at our guidance ranges, it's -- we've an opportunity to do some additional volumes without moving inventories to higher levels. But also price, price continues to firm in many markets.

So I think if there are restrictions that come into place, that's incrementally positive from where we are today.

On retail, you're able to hit the 10.5% margin year-to-date, and that's in line, I guess, at the lower end of your target for 2023. Just curious if you could update us on, I guess, what the road map is to hitting that target on an annualized basis? And whether -- given you're hitting the 10.5% now, whether we should be a little bit more aggressive in what we're assuming you guys can do that?""]",question_answer

So I think your question was pertaining to the recent announcement of the acquisition that we signed in Brazil, that was Terra Nova. And so as Mayo said in his commentary, we continue to build out our focus on constructing a comprehensive retail model in Brazil, similar to what we have in the U.S. and across North America and around the world. We've made very good progress. And as Mayo said, have now announced 4 acquisitions in the last 18 months that are helping contribute to our footprint there.With respect to Terra Nova specifically, it's a 9-branch business operation, a very attractive footprint in the region of Minas Gerais. We also do have a presence already in this region. And so this will continue to strengthen our footprint. Whereas in the U.S., we have a very strong market share, 20-plus percent, which gives us strong competitive advantages. We're in the very early stages of our potential opportunity in Brazil. And so while this does give us a good foothold in market, there's a lot of room for us to continue to expand our model in the country, both with retail location acquisitions, but also, as Jeff described earlier, bringing our integrated model that involves proprietary products and full acreage solutions for growers. So we're optimistic about the opportunity and continuing to look for value-enhancing acquisition opportunities in Brazil.""]",question_answer
