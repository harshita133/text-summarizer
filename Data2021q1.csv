2,1046,Mayo M. Schmidt,"[""Thank you, Richard, and good morning. I want to thank you for joining the Nutrien team today as we share news of our exceptional results and strong outlook. Nutrien has a portfolio of integrated and related businesses that provide competitive advantages. Our team is excited to execute our long-term and Board-approved strategy. This includes our 2023 financial and operational targets as well as our recently unveiled ESG targets and commitments. We are dedicated to growing Nutrien through superior operational performance and focused capital allocation to create shareholder value. The very tight global supply and demand growth has led to strong pricing across virtually all crops, and we anticipate a tight supply and demand environment continuing through 2021 and beyond. As we speak today, growers are responding by increasing seeded acreage and are focused on maximizing yields. It's really an exciting time to be in agriculture, and as the world's largest provider of crop inputs and services, we are also helping growers meet increasing global food demands. We're focused on the challenges of ensuring food security, safety and climate action. We recently issued our new ESG report highlighting how Nutrien will focus on helping to transform the agriculture industry with 3 priority areas: feeding the planet sustainably, environment and climate action and inclusive agriculture. We will be hosting a detailed review of our priorities, key commitments and targets as well as our market-leading carbon program at our ESG update in June.Now turning to our first quarter results and outlook. We delivered excellent performance across all our business units. Our outlook for the second quarter is very positive as field work and seeding are progressing very well, and our expectations are for higher acreage in North America. As the largest ag retailer in multiple countries, we are seeing firsthand strong interest of growers to maximize yields, and we are fully prepared to serve them with our broad selection of crop inputs and services. Our service offering includes our leading proprietary products, our direct producer relationships while fielding more than 3,600 agronomists globally, an input financing program and our investments in innovative digital tools. Our Nutrien Ag Solutions retail business delivered a record first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $109 million due to strong margins across virtually all product lines and geographies. Retail sales increased 12% year-over-year, and gross margins rose to 22%. Fertilizer margins were strengthened by the rapid rise in prices this quarter, although margins are expected to normalize in the second quarter as retail's more recent fertilizer purchases have been made at higher levels. U.S. crop nutrient volumes were up just over 10% year-over-year while total retail volumes were up 20% and gross margin per tonne was nearly $15 per tonne higher. Crop protection margins in all geographies demonstrated year-over-year improvement this quarter. The market has been fairly tight for certain products and regions due to the combination of the February freeze impacting production in the U.S., strong global demand and recent logistical bottlenecks, both international and domestic. However, due to the strength of our supply chain, Nutrien Ag Solutions is well positioned with product availability for our growers' requirements for the season. We also reported improvements across our retail metrics this quarter. Total retail adjusted EBITDA to sales surpassed 10% and was over 11% in the U.S. while adjusted EBITDA per U.S. selling location increased to over $1.1 million. Retail lowered their cash operating coverage ratio to 60%. We continue to see impressive performance and utilization of our digital ag platform, all metrics showing significant year-over-year improvement. In potash, our business continues to build momentum with near-record sales volumes in the North American market for the first quarter and solid demand internationally. Ken Seitz and the potash team are optimizing production across our 6 mines and progressing automated mining projects that will together improve safety performance, lower cost and further reduce our carbon footprint. Our cash cost of production was lower by about $3 per tonne compared to the first quarter of last year despite an increase in the value of the Canadian dollar. We achieved significantly higher potash sales volumes this quarter despite the extremely cold weather in February, which slowed logistics and deferred offshore shipments, shifting about 300,000 tonnes of our planned international sales into the balance of 2021. Demand for our nitrogen products remained strong across North America, with prices rising rapidly during the quarter. Raef Sully and his team delivered strong operating results, achieving a 97% North American ammonia operating rate despite downtime due to extreme cold weather events in February. Sales volumes decreased year-over-year due to the lower starting inventories due to a robust fall season in 2020 and reduced production in Trinidad. Our phosphate operations posted a strong quarter with $97 million in EBITDA due to higher realized prices. We do expect margins to temper going forward as costs rise from the much stronger sulfur and ammonia prices.Now turning to the outlook. New crop corn and soybean prices and the cash margins are approximately 60% higher than this time last year while spot prices have approximately doubled. The rally in crop prices highlights the tightness in global supply and demand balances and the sensitivity to any potential supply risk in 2021. Retail has experienced excellent demand for products and services, and the mood amongst growers is very positive. We believe the final seeded acreage for corn and soybeans could be about 4 million acres higher than the USDA March intentions report. Even at a higher U.S. seeded acreage, we expect to see a continuation of tight stocks-to-use ratios and strong crop prices in the next year. We have increased our annual EBITDA guidance by $400 million to $4.4 billion to $4.9 billion in 2021. The increase is across all business units, supported by continued strength in crop and fertilizer prices and a very positive outlook for potash in the second half of the year. We believe the potash inventories in the major global markets remain low for this time of year and that global demand will be 68 million to 70 million metric tonnes. We're expecting as much as a 20% increase in potash imports in Indonesia and Malaysia this year, exceptional demand in North America and continued growth in South America and Asia. Canpotex is fully committed on volumes into September and anticipates it will gain market share in the higher netback regions outside of China and India. The recent increase in the Baltic dry freight index is expected to have minor impact on our offshore potash netbacks. Year-over-year, ocean freight rates are approximately $20 per tonne higher. We anticipate the impact to our international potash netbacks will be less than $10 per tonne in 2021 due to Canpotex long-term freight arrangements. We anticipate North American nitrogen and phosphate prices will remain firm through the application season. Our realized nitrogen prices in the second quarter will be supported by the higher proportion of ag-related sales. We expect typical summer seasonal pricing and some moderation in nitrogen prices in the second half of the year due to an increase in global urea export availability from China and some new capacity coming onstream globally. However, we continue to be constructive on the nitrogen market outlook for the medium and long term.In closing, we believe agriculture fundamentals have positive momentum and Nutrien is exceptionally well positioned to benefit from the multiyear strength expected in crop and fertilizer markets. We also see great opportunity to demonstrate and benefit from our commitment to delivering products, technologies and services to ensure we can collectively feed the planet more sustainably. We're uniquely advantaged to collaborate with growers and industry partners to launch and scale a comprehensive carbon program that has the potential to accelerate climate-smart agriculture. The interest in the program is apparent as we're oversubscribed for our 2021 farm pilots.Before we begin the question-and-answer portion of all, I'd like to thank Chuck Magro on behalf of employees, customers and shareholders for his contribution over the past 11 years and do wish him success with his next steps. With that, operator, I'd like to open the call to questions for our leadership team here today.""]",management_discussion,NTR.TO_208023,23,NTR.TO,1,2021-05-04 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2021,2021

5,1049,Mayo M. Schmidt,"[""Well, thanks for that question. The Board of Directors and Chuck mutually agreed that Chuck step down after a decade of strong leadership, and it was my honor to accept the role of President and CEO for Nutrien. Regarding the Nutrien strategy, certainly, I had a front-row seat in developing and working with the team as Chairman of the Board with an aspect of driving industry performance across all our business lines. I might also mention that when we go back to the value that's been created through the MOE, the merger of equals, with PotashCorp, I headed that committee from a Board level.

7,1051,Benjamin  Isaacson,"[""Maybe a question for Jason Newton, if he's there.

Can you address that, please?""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208023,23,NTR.TO,1,2021-05-04 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2021,2021
8,1052,Jason  Newton,"[""Sure. Ben, I think we've seen really a couple of consecutive really strong application seasons in the U.S., starting with last fall, with really ideal weather and then continued strength and demand this spring. If you look at where affordability is, potash prices remain very attractive relative to where crop prices are, still well below average from an index relative to corn costs, and we see that supporting demand. And I think as we look toward the summer fill period, which leads into the fall of 2021, I think there's already interest building for summer fill, and we expect that the inventories through the supply chain will be relatively low once we get to end of the spring planting season. We know that as we look toward the fall, weather is really important, but the crop is getting in the ground at a good pace, which sets up well for the growing season. And then as we get into next year, we think the supply/demand fundamentals in major crops continues to look strong, which should be supportive of continued strength in crop prices and affordability in the spring of 2022, which should continue to support high levels of application rates and demand.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208023,23,NTR.TO,1,2021-05-04 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2021,2021

And more specifically to your point, I think an internalization of operational benefits between the business units focusing on pipeline margins, facility utilization, areas around logistics, transportation, which I say I've got quite a deep background in, and also working capital. And I do think we're really focused on our structural advantages. We think about how we focus the organization on our proprietary, the scale of our transportation. And then I would say the symmetry and balance within our system, which in my view can enhance the pipeline utilization of products and growth and creating profitability when we can find opportunities for growth both organically and through acquisition and making sure those are profitable in the first full year of operation.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208023,23,NTR.TO,1,2021-05-04 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2021,2021

15,1059,Jeff  Tarsi,"[""Yes, sure. Thanks, Mayo. P.J., I agree. I mean look, there's a lot of optimism out in the network today, especially with our customers. We see people -- I like to use the term swinging for the fences. They're going to do everything in their power to maximize yields in 2021, no matter what the crop is, corn, soybeans, cotton and wheat and various other crops with it. As far as maybe trading up on the seed side of things, I don't see so much trading up on the traits side of things. The traits side of it is more determined by pest pressure. And -- but what we do see is we increasingly see our growers using technology to trade up on the germplasm side and being able to match the best germplasm possible to the different soil that they have on their farm. Our digital agronomy platform is allowing us to really utilize those 2 going forward. But look, we're going to see growers really pull the inputs to this crop this year. If I look at our nutritional -- proprietary nutritional business, I'm seeing that today with some of the inferred allocations that are being made. Again, they're putting the very best germplasm out there. And we think they're going to do everything they can to protect this crop as we go through the season.

As a matter of fact if I look at our share through the quarter with Dyna-Gro, I see our shares increase across corn, soybeans, cotton and canola, which will be on the prudent side of things. But no, we don't take a back seat when it comes to Dyna-Gro. And if you look at our yields as it relates to those 5 crops, we compete with anything out on the market.

26,1070,Raef M. Sully,"[""Yes. Sure, Michael. So let me just start in North America. You will have noticed, over the past couple of years, a steady increase in our utilization rates. That's a result, I think, of some of the synergies that we got out of the merger. This year, we've got 2 large turnarounds. We -- during these -- the last couple of years, we've also been trying to take care of some large end-of-life issues where equipment is coming up to 40 or 50 years of service. We have 2 large turnarounds. We're in one at the moment at Borger, Texas, and we have another one starting in a couple of months in Redwater. That's pretty normal for us to have one turnaround a year in the U.S. and one turnaround in Canada. The unusual thing about this is they're a bit larger than normal because of these end-of-life issues that we talked about. So coming out of those, we expect to see an increase in production capability and continued increase in reliability. Trinidad, a little bit different story there. We have 4 plants, as you know. At the moment, all 4 of them are actually running. 2 of them, however, are running at reduced rates. And we have a turnaround plan for one of the plants down there in -- starting in a few weeks' time and then another smaller minor turnaround later in the year.

45,1089,Kenneth A. Seitz,"[""Yes. You bet, Mayo. Sure. And thanks, Duffy, for the question. So yes, it is a unique year with respect to the contracting process in China. Of course, that contract with one of the big international suppliers was on the heels of an agreement with India at the same price level of $247. We're watching Chinese inventory levels quite closely at the moment, exactly as you say, Duffy, because demand in China will be strong this year and will continue to be strong going forward. Inventory levels at the moment are about 2.5 million tonnes. That's down from about 3.7 million tonnes this time last year. And important to note that of that 2.5 million tonnes, 1.5 million is the so-called strategic reserves, so really only 1 million tonnes sitting at the port that's usable. If we look inland at Qinghai Salt Lake, we believe that those inventories were completed at the end of last year and continues to be the case. So inventories level are low, to your point. Canpotex has said that it's committed right through to the end of August. And so it remains to be seen how the contracting situation will evolve in China with this very strong demand and with inventory levels coming down. So yes, I think it plays into the timing around discussion for a new contract or a new price level in China. And again, that remains to be seen as we watch this strong demand and the depletion of inventories with, frankly, suppliers targeting other higher-netback markets in the world as opposed to sending as much potash to China.

So we've bumped our forecast of Chinese urea exports to between 4 million and 5.5 million tonnes. The top end of the range would be in line with where exports were last year. And I think what drives getting to the top end of the range is a delay in commissioning and the ramp-up of some of the urea projects that we see coming onstream in the second half of the year, in addition to continued strength and demand from India. And that's a bit tight as one of those urea projects is in India. We know that Indian production year-to-date is down about 500,000 tonnes but is projected to be up on the full year.

If you think about where we were 2012 through 2018, there was obviously a lot of supply, and the market prices were down. 2018 forward, we're not seeing the same amount of projects coming online. The overall nitrogen market is about 150 million tonnes globally at the moment and growing at 1.5 million to 2.5 million tonnes a year, so a full world-scale ammonia to a degree.So we're seeing that tightening now. We're expecting it to tighten a little earlier. But you saw that last year's second quarter, we saw a decline due to COVID, and industrial demand had dropped about 20%. We've seen that industrial demand come back and come back strongly. And so there may well be a little reset as we get out of the spring season. We're expecting a very strong spring season, but there's always a little bit of a reset in summer. We just don't think it's going to be as marked as we've seen historically.

Can you comment on whether that is still the case? And I ask because that -- the fertilizer price inflation during the first quarter was robust. And so the question is when did your retail channel essentially lock in the purchase pricing for the fertilizer that was sold in that quarter?

We have to start well, well ahead of time of putting inventory in our sheds, and we did last fall. We were able to obviously take advantage at the time of some lower prices. And as we came into this first quarter, as you've seen with our numbers, we were able to take advantage of some of that inflation that we saw on those fertilizer tonnes. And I think our guys have done a great job out there trying to price as close to replacement as we can. Obviously, we're running out of that inventory on that -- what I would call that first turn. We're actually having to buy back into the market some today. And I think in the second quarter, you'll obviously see more normalized margins as it relates to -- from a per-tonne basis on it. But I'll also add, Steve, that we've worked really hard on our proprietary nutritionals, and those kind of figure into that margin per tonne basis, too. And we've done a lot of great work with that to grow products and things like that, that are also contributing to that margin as well with it. But -- and again, as I've mentioned earlier, we've seen rate increases as well as these growers are really optimistic about giving their crops every chance to maximize yield and such.

Last fall with getting an early, early harvest in really good conditions, we were able to get most of our soils prepared for this '21 cropping season, and that makes a tremendous difference as you come into the season. I think you would have seen that this past week with the planning progress that we were able to make. Growers were able to just crop right in and start their farming practices, and that really bodes well for the crop protection side of the business because there are a lot of chemistries we use there. We call it a burndown capacity or really decimating weeds that are up prior to planting. We're also able to get in and put a lot of our pre-emergence-type herbicides on this acreage as well as it relates to that versus if you come into a year where you need to start spring with a lot of tillage, you do that mechanically versus organically with crop protection chemicals and such. And from the seed side of things that relates to competition on it, I would say that competition is more keen on the soybean side of things as it -- versus corn and cotton for that matter. But I also would say it's not anything that's really unusual or that we might not see during a normal course of the year.

75,1119,Mayo M. Schmidt,"[""Thanks, Adrien. We're certainly focused on our business and driving the most value for shareholders. We do expect to see long-term potash demand continue to grow. There'll obviously be a competitor, and I'll leave their decisions and economics to them. But when we think about our system, we're the world's largest soft rock miner and potash producer by capacity. We've got a tremendous network of flexible mines, 6 low-cost mines. Our automation has been going remarkably well and a proven track record. And I think the other thing I think about too with our potash business, as you know, getting to tide water. Ken and his team have done a tremendous job of, now historically was a great success in the industry, loading 100 car trains, and Ken's loading 200 car trains going to tide water. So it's a combination of the internal and external infrastructure, and we're really well balanced in our system. So the idea of obviously challenges or cooperating with competitors but at the same time, we're focused on price and efficiencies. And Ken, you may wish to comment further about the automation programs you're bringing. And taking your costs out by $3 was really quite impressive.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208023,23,NTR.TO,1,2021-05-04 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2021,2021
76,1120,Kenneth A. Seitz,"[""Yes. No, thank you, Mayo. And Adrien, yes absolutely. I mean we make our own decisions independent of what our competitors are doing. We just maintain that we have 5 million tonnes of available capacity ready to go into the market and brownfield opportunities -- significant brownfield opportunities beyond that. From -- production costs but also development costs would be the most competitive in the world, so we feel pretty good about our position. And then you layer on some of the advantages that Mayo just described, including, as Mayo said, some of the work that we're doing on our mine of the future. We have all of our mining machines with operator-not-present equipment in the largest potash mine in the world at Rocanville. And we're outfitting the balance of our mines as well. And that's just one example of several projects we have on the way to get better, reduce costs and improve safety. So we feel pretty good about our trajectory and where we're heading with our decision-making.""]",question_answer,NTR.TO_208023,23,NTR.TO,1,2021-05-04 10:01:01,NTR.TO - Earnings call Q1 2021,2021
